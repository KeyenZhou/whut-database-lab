CS2 also has a huge \"New Player\" problem. For this reason alone it is hard to recommend to prospective new players.Counter-Strike is a 20+ year old game. Many people will know that going in to it. I knew that when transferring over from Valorant with 600+ hours played and a Gold/Plat level average rank.To say it\'s a struggle learning CS2 as a new player is an understatement, I\'ve personally struggled to integrate myself into the game and community even with 600 hours of transferable skills from a very similar game. Counter-strafing, callouts and lineups are all key aspects of CS2 that you\'ll only find out about by being screamed at by another more seasoned player (If they have mics!)There was no real reason to update CSGO to CS2 unless Valve plan for some level of future growth and enticing new players and CS2 desperately needs a more welcoming environment for new players. Many of the community veterans will just say \"It\'s a high skilled game, either learn the skill ceiling or find another game\" which sounds great and is very cool but it\'s an impractical way of looking at video game and community development. It\'s unwelcoming and unproductive. Valve, this game requires a better on-boarding experience if you want to capture disillusioned Valorant players or grow the audience to continue the sustainability of this series.CS2 needs better tutorials, training options and frankly most importantly, a more robust reporting system.The community in this game is fundamentally unwelcoming and bad actors face almost no punishment. If they do actually receive any punishment, I shouldn\'t need a third-party bot to message me on Steam to tell me as such (Hi Leetify!)Please look at transferring some of the excellent reporting and community safe-guarding features from DOTA 2 and bringing them to CS2.',''),(37,'cs2 doesn\'t work on linuxcss works on linuxsource > source 2',''),(38,'csgo',''),(39,'As an enthusiast deeply immersed in the gaming realm, my anticipation for Counter-Strike 2 was palpable. Having been in development for an extended period, the sequel garnered significant attention within the gaming community, stemming from its predecessor, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO).The title earned commendation for its noticeable strides in graphics and physics, applauded for the introduction of new maps and weaponry that seamlessly integrate into the gameplay. Yet, amidst this praise, criticisms emerged regarding its perceived lack of innovation. Some felt the game reprised its predecessor with only marginal enhancements, failing to introduce groundbreaking features.Novice players encountered a steep learning curve, encountering difficulty in assimilating into the game. Counter-Strike 2 appeared tailored for seasoned players seeking an arduous challenge, compounded by the suboptimal matchmaking system that impeded quick match discoveries.However, the game\'s competitive landscape remained robust, sustaining its status as a frontrunner among first-person shooter games. The fervent community continually contributes to the game\'s vibrancy, constantly crafting fresh maps and mods, fostering an environment brimming with creativity.Summarily, Counter-Strike 2 caters well to the series\' loyal followers. While it introduces slight enhancements over its predecessor, it regrettably doesn\'t break new ground in innovation. The game\'s steep learning curve might deter potential players, yet for ardent fans, exploring this iteration holds merit. If you\'ve been invested in the series, delving into Counter-Strike 2 is certainly worth considering.',''),(40,'My friend who I play with said if I post a review on this game and it gets 200 likes and 200 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 3060 and 2 Kilos of canned ham.

After losing a character that I built up for a while, I was furious for about half a minute, then I immediately loaded back in with a new character because this game is just unbelievably addicting. At first I secured a house, and felt like that was all I needed to do. Then I secured a commercial building and had plans to make it into a steel fortress. Then I realized that all the skill traits and character building had a purpose, and I set out to build my first real base. While currently in the building phase for this base, I am learning more and more every time I get on this game. Also worth noting, the workshop for this game is filled with mods to make your experience more enjoyable, or more difficult.

I defended them for years, they were going through an engine rewrite, gamedev is hard etc, but years after release and continuous development, many major updates, you can\'t put things down without them occasionally disappearing. If your inventory has slots for the thing you\'re putting away, even if you\'re replacing a like for like item (eg: weapon mag,) it will just drop on the ground if they\'re different orientations in inventory. Even sometimes if they\'re the same. If you take out a, for example,  walkie/GPS (which has its own special inventory slot) with a hotkey, then put it away, the game will ignore that slot and if you have no other space, just drop it on the ground without telling you. Sometimes you\'ll spawn into the same server you left as an alive character and suddenly be dead for no reason with a new spawn. Walk down a staircase and your character has a seizure. Also - solid objects like walls are often a mere suggestion to the undead. You\'ll frequently get all the way to military areas, which takes hours, aggro a zombie, and then get kicked because the server can\'t handle the zombies and loot. But because when you leave your character stays in game for 15s to prevent combat-logging, your character just sits there dying helplessly, even when it\'s a server frackup, so you die through no fault of your own. which is a common themeIt can be a pretty mellow camping simulator, but the game is objectively bad. They removed the mechanics which change your appearance if you\'re friendly or a bandit because it\'s \"not realistic\" but then added a counter for survivors killed, which besides also not being realistic in game psychology means it\'s the only thing players can track as a form of progression, so of course they\'ll see that as \"what you\'re supposed to do.\" Those together destroy any chance of not being killed on sight. The devs do not understand what made the mod back in the day a global phenomenon, because you could arguably look past the fact that the product straight up does not work because it had a great community which had reasons to actually create interesting human stories more interesting than \"saw a guy, killed him\". It really sucks if one of the best things in your game was the hackers, especially when you get rid of them and realise that substantially, there\'s nothing really left. You can learn the mechanics, but in any other game that\'s the start of actually having fun with it, once you figure it out there\'s nothing more ... There. Also, half of those mechanics are just outright dumb, while the game is supposed to be realistic above all. Open a tin of beans with dirty hands? Of course you\'ll get sick, because your character decides the best way to eat a mostly liquid food out of a cup-shaped container is to stick your fingers in like a 4-year-old instead of drinking from the tin like a functioning adult. But just-as-dirty gloves are fine. It\'s something you can learn fast, but it\'s one of many examples of \"realism\" actually being fake difficulty that makes no sense to pad out the time you spend in the game before realising its lack of anything real to offerPros: Can be mellow and beautiful at times if you want a camping / hunting sim with a chance of being murdered at any time. It\'s also a good exercise in nihilism and learning to accept and embrace loss as an inevitable part of life Cons:Literally everything else. The game is an indefensible, nonfunctioning PoS. It still plays like a pre-alpha, and they actively turned it into a shooter with crazy long rounds instead of the fascinating survival game that made it famous. Which is a real shame, because they began with a winning formula that I adored and systematically fracked up every part of it. 10 years after they started selling the game, it still doesn\'t have feature parity with the mod that made it, which would be fine as a conscious design decision, which it famously isn\'t. A ton of people stan it because it lets you experiment with sadism, killing someone actually affecting something they\'ve been working for for hours or days, so they really feel the loss, which is interesting and has its place, but doesn\'t excuse the product you pay for being outright broken, and it\'s the only way anyone you\'re likely to run into actually plays which gets old fast I always eventually come back to this game out of hope, because it had the potential to be more amazing than any other, but I always uninstall it because it\'s quantifiably bad',''),(85,'Warning (0x00040031)You were kicked off the game.Login error:Login timed out.(WaitAuthPlayerLoginState)',''),(86,'I will leave the cat here, so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards　　　 　　／＞　　フ　　　 　　| 　_　 _ l　 　　 　／` ミ＿xノ　　 　 /　　　 　 |　　　 /　 ヽ　　 ﾉ　 　 │　　|　|　|　／￣|　　 |　|　|　| (￣ヽ＿_ヽ_)__)　＼二つ',''),(87,'> Join first server on first life> Loot a few buildings> Stab a zombie> Oh ♥♥♥♥ the sun is setting> Build a fire to stay warm> Two heavily armed german guys appear out of thin air.

Well I can assure that Cities - Skylines has your deepest darkest anguish in mind, because you will not only be planning roads and highways yourself, but you\'ll be able to watch your infrastructure crumble at the tiniest mistakes as well!  Laying down roads in this game is deceptive.  It basically progression checks you early on when you\'re first building your city, so you only have access to whatever your population is, which means you can\'t really perceive yet how much of a nightmare everything is going to be and the game does a very poor job of visually telling you, yes- even with topographical information filters that you can access through the interface- what is currently or about to go horribly wrong with your own layout.  Really you won\'t know its a complete wash until systems start to break down.  I\'ll admit, I don\'t want to build an entire map of roundabouts just to manage traffic, and I never got the hang of the highway systems because it felt weird bulldozing my entire downtown area just because the influx of traffic getting in or out of the city had increased.  Like where do these roads NEED to go?  It never really explains what a good design is because you\'re quickly putting out fires with stop-gap solutions like bus stops or subways.Personally I never really liked the way plumbing and electricity work either, with very finicky power lines or having to account for noise, or pollution until you reach cleaner energy sources to build way later on.  These are all totally locked out and you still have to worry about city policies, fire departments, police departments, hospitals, education, and then even college campuses.  Don\'t even get me started on parks & recreation or tourism, because those are all concepts introduced when you\'re still trying to get the hang of building up your city without setting everything on fire.  The whole game feels like dominoes are about to fall, but you\'re always holding the last one up, slowly preventing the eventual collapse of absolutely everything you\'ve done or accomplished.  ..and I hate that.Its just not as rewarding or as fun as something a bit less realistic like the older Simcity games.  Even Simcity 4 was more visually rewarding when you opened up the tax mini-menu to spike the industrial sectors to 20% taxes in order to move in nothing but clean tech industry moguls and buildings instead.  The systems in Cities are just a little more complex, certainly not impossible to understand, but they take so much time and experimentation to get things just right.  It also doesn\'t help that sometimes icons float above buildings and I check tab after tab to see what\'s going on or why its not getting what it needs, but it just refuses to make sense as to why it has problems.  Not having access to information as to why a scenario is going wrong is a HUGE pet peeve of mine in any city-building title, so having it in Cities behemoth-like presentation is stupid.  Theirs a ton of DLC for this game that I never bought, I always just had the original, so if a lot of DLC fixes issues I had, that\'s totally fine, but the base game is missing many things.. probably actual fun gameplay the most.  Eventually your city becomes massive and its totally overwhelming.

This game is only good and accepted because it is the only game that offers this kind of experience, no matter how broken, poorly designed and generally frustrating that experience may be. The vast majority of the playtime in this game is spent trying to exploit or circumvent poorly implemented and poorly designed mechanics. The game actively tries to stop you from having any fun. Battles: The battle AI is just sad... it will either run to the edge of the map if you overpower it or it will just rush you in an uncoordinated manner when it thinks it has an advantage. No tactics, no skill, no challenge. Overworld: Despite being told from day one that kingdoms are completely unbalanced, nothing meaningful has ever been done to address that. The Khuzaits and Aserai will just roll across the map if left unattended. Map AI is better than battle AI at least but there is some anti-player bias. Clan: This is one aspect I do enjoy. It\'s decently enjoyable to grow your clan, have members be born, companions lost in battle, assemble caravans, assign governors and other parties. Economy: Probably the most poorly designed aspect of the game. The devs actively want to prevent you from having any passive income. As of the last patch they completely destroyed Workshops. Cities, towns, castles and workshops provide no money, while garrisons cost huge amounts. You are actively punished for having many cities and high quality troops. You\'re left with roaming the land selling blacksmith weapons and other loot for your warchest. Overall: At the end of the day, this game is just unfun. Game mechanics actively work against you and despite thousand of comments and years of feedback, devs are refusing to implement common sense changes to make the game the fun sandbox we\'ve always wanted. Mod scene is basically dead as the game is unstable and any small update breaks all mods. After waiting almost 10 years for this game, I now have little hope this game will ever get meaningfully better.',''),(192,'ur money or ur life..AGHRGHRHGRHG10/10',''),(193,'Buy it on a sale.A year after release and it still feels half empty. \" engage in diplomacy, craft, trade and conquer new lands in a vast medieval sandbox\" What diplomacy?

SP mechanics are theoretically there but after playing a while you can see how shallow they actually are and how much work is still left to make this actually a FULL RELEASE and not early access. MP is actually what made me stay with this game, its an incredible feeling when you get a 100 vs 100 player siege going, that being said, MP is also already dying/dead - there are only two servers to play on, a few maps, constant server crashes (like every 3-4 maps there is a crash and servers are down for 30 mins).Overall this game just never really left early access, and should still be branded as such.

AI in games is lacking, so cheating resources or men or power to help the AI remain competitive helps keep the game engaging and challenging. Games cheat by letting the player sneak past enemies, even though they should by all rights be able to see a full-grown person crouching only 20 feet away. Games cheat, but the balance of cheating is what makes a game fun or frustrating.In this game players complain that the game cheats by spawning lords with 20 men in their party. Players do not complain about cheating when the game deletes entire clans from the game, but not the player clan. Because it benefits them. Which I understand. If a restaurant accidentally gives you an extra serving of fries, who would speak up and offer to return said fries?I feel the balance of this game has changed towards making it easier to snowball. You know, that thing people hate in strategy games. The devs have pushed an update that allows kingdoms to be destroyed, making world conquest easier, but in doing so have revoked the right to exist from some kingdoms and entire cultures in this game. The Battanian\'s always lose without the players help, and now they and many of their clans will be destroyed unless the player makes it their goal to preserve the Battanian Kingdom.This most recent update has hurt the way I preferred to play the game. I have conquered the map once, a feat I never bothered to accomplish in Warband, and in doing so have lost all ambition to do so again.\"And Alexander wept, seeing as he had no more worlds to conquer.\"This quote perfectly describes my problem with \"painting the map\". So I don\'t. I play to enjoy everything the game has to offer besides world conquest. And I LIKE it. After this recent update, every game I play will inevitably be reduced to 3 or 4 kingdoms becoming world powers and controlling the entire map. The AI has no mercy for weak kingdoms, and with no civil wars or kingdom creation, the world map will become small in a sense, as the diversity and uniqueness of other factions will fade. Although I will add that the player can create kingdoms, but the game is buggy as the devs clearly never intended for the player to create a kingdom, then leave it. The kingdoms colors will change to match the players, even if the player joins a completely different kingdoms.I am glad that players who want landless kingdoms to be destroyed can enjoy their game, but I cannot enjoy such a feature.I will remove this negative review when the devs make kingdom destruction optional.',''),(196,'With the recent update (1.2.7) they removed the ability to invert the attack and block directions by mouse movement making the game basically impossible to play for me',''),(197,'This game feels so abandoned by the devs.Yes it is released and it works with what it is by now.

The prices of products today seemed to be exactly the price tomorrow. The NPCs said more or less the same thing over and over, the sentinels (the main \'enemy\' you encounter) were just dumb.

I bought this recently on sale, many years after initial release, so I imagine the game has improved quite a lot since then. But I can only recommend this game as a mostly single-player experience. Multiplayer seems like mostly an afterthought, with large amounts of de-syncing. It is not a good feeling when you search for a resolution for a specific bug and the community replies to just turn off all multiplayer functionality. Additionally, ship combat and flight controls feel weak but I guess this is okay for the target audience; if you\'re use to flying your ship like a mad-man in Elite Dangerous, you\'ll be disappointed. I would even say that the flight controls in Freelancer (2003) feel more responsive. Base building is kinda lame when it comes to terraforming, you\'ll see all the terrain regenerate and clip into your structures but some of the community insists that this is okay and \"working as designed\". So as I\'ve seen other suggest, build upwards to overcome this. Finally, getting the frigate so early feels like it defeats the purpose of a planet-side base.

This game is kind of Civilization in space, but with way more complexity than Civilization. Most people will go the conquest route in their first playthrough, but there are ample options for winning through any combination of diplomacy, economics/trade, science dev, etc. Also, it was clearly made by developers who love sci fi, so there are lots of easter eggs and concepts from many sci fi books, TV shows, etc.Don\'t be intimidated by the DLC and in fact I recommend NOT getting them until you start playing the game to get an idea of what elements you enjoy. The base game is good and complete and the DLC just add more options and complexity. As I mentioned, the game is complex enough as is and has plenty of options, so the DLC is really a way to keep the game fresh for existing players rather than a way to unlock needed features. Also, I recommend watching any of a number of HowToPlay YouTube tutorials (MaxTheCatfish has a good series) about Stellaris before playing to understand how things work, because most of the mechanics are not explained in game. This game is a major time sink, so it\'s probably worth watching a couple of hours of beginner\'s guides and tutorials before playing to save yourself even more time wasted with mistakes in game.',''),(268,'This game isn\'t complete without the DLC and it really makes sure you know it. NPC factions will have access to tech you can\'t have without DLC, every update that adds DLC drastically changes something about the base game to make it incomplete without the DLC that was added. Empire sprawl used to be as simple as \"Build more administrative buildings, have more capacity.\" They updated that to be more complicated and hard to manage, without the DLC at least. Same with vassals, when Overlord came out they completely redid the vassal system, and obtaining and integrating vassals became much harder and convoluted in the base game.      I quit playing after Overlord released, and I\'m only posting this review because I looked back at the store page to see if getting the DLC on sale would be a good idea. The ultimate bundle at 50% off right now is nearly 10x as much as the game is on sale. They want you to buy the game cheap, get hooked on what\'s basically the demo, then buy 200$ of DLC to get the complete experience. Not worth your time or money unless you have 30$ to fork over every month (or you can magically get access to the DLC...), because the base game only gets worse with every DLC release.',''),(269,'You can design your own alien species, and do with  it anything you can dream of.I choose to play the base Humans and remind the Xenos they aren\'t made in God\'s image.',''),(270,'After nearly 2,000 hours of game time since May 9th 2016 I think it is finally time to leave a review. TL;DR - Over priced, out-dated engine with severe issues in performance, poor update and DLC policy/management, not a great looking future after 2023.This is a game that, when compared to it\'s original 1.0 release is now unrecognisable throughout the vast majority if not all of it\'s mechanics and features. While I of course appreciate that updates and DLCs will inevitably change core parts of the game, much of the change has been through updates that accompany the DLCs (meaning the update costs you nothing, purchasing the DLC merely unlocks certain features for the player to directly use that are now in the game thanks to said updates) essentially meaning that regardless of buying the latest DLC/expansion you are going to be locked into the new features, for better or worse.Now, let us discuss these updates and DLCs and the ever worsening QA that comes with them; not only will you have to re-learn major parts of the game\'s mechanics time and time again nullifying everything you\'ve learnt over the many hours you\'ve spent in game already, you\'ll quickly find many of the new features won\'t work, nor will they for quite some time meaning that you\'ll have to re-learn the new mechanics again as they don\'t operate the same way when fixed as they did when broken. This is an issue that is increasingly frustrating as the price of these DLCs only keeps going up with the quality and content going down.Moving onto costs; well, it is a Paradox game so there\'s no surprise when it comes to the grand total. If you want the full experience it will set you back just shy of £300 when not on sale. As far as I am concerned this is not worth it, especially after the past year of updates and releases which have, in my opinion, degraded what was once arguably the best modern sci-fi 4X game available. If you really want to give it a try, I would highly recommend waiting for a free weekend that comes about every now and then or a minimum of a 65-70% discount.',''),(271,'Used to be a really fun game but the paragons DLC kinda just started a downward trend of bad decision after bad decision, the latest DLC astral planes is basically a tiny storypack for $20 which is way too much for what its worth',''),(272,'Why does the DLC which barely adds any content cost hundreds of dollars.

I have been playing Paradox games since the original Hearts of Iron but no more. The game on it\'s own is a decent 4x strategy game but I can not support the scummy practices of Paradox. The varying travel methods per civilization is one of the main reasons I bought this game. They were removed for \"balance\" reasons and added back in later as paid DLC. Also the game gets pretty boring for me after the exploration phase.',''),(274,'Unfortunately with how many hours into this game I just can\'t justify buying this game.Stellaris used to be great, really did but as they continue to change things and make it ever complicated. meanwhile they have completely given up on trying to improve performance, if you\'re gonna play the game unfortunately you have to play small or tiny galaxy, don\'t even bother with large or extra large galaxy.  the game continues to lag end game, they have tried everything to fix the end game lag, at the end of the day it just simply isn\'t fixable so you have to ask yourself \"is it really worth playing if its just gonna lag at the end and make it unplayable?\" oh you wanna play with friends? again don\'t bother, stellaris is notorious for \"Desyncs\" basically all players become desynced and the game is no longer playable, you can try googling, restarting, you could have the fastest best computer, all of your friends could have the fastest best computer, it happens anyways. which its kind of funny cause at one point they did fix it, but then it came back and since then again they gave up on trying to fix it. but aside from the fact their game is unplayable it doesn\'t stop them from continuing to release DLC\'s. which I understand that a company has got to make money, but come on... honestly at this point its time for stellaris to die. hopefully stellaris 2 will be remade on a better engine, better performance, better everything. Look up stellaris Nexus, its literally a 5 player game cause at the end of the day thats all they can realistically do without impacting performance.

It happens wherever you park the fleet, and I searched the internet for a solution - but there is none.Next weird thing, and probably the worst one is that if you somehow manage to attack a faction in the early game, and you have a superior fleet - the game will make peace with the enemy faction and it will be a status quo. You will not get the territory that you claimed. If anything - third party always gets it.Next fun thing is that if a part of your faction rebels and you see it as an act of war, even though they don\'t have shipyards, and even though they have no army - they will have an overwhelming army presence without any 3rd party involvement.

particularly at the beginning of the game if the player lacks the context of The Witcher 2 and is prone to skipping cut-scenes. however after a couple of hours at the beginning of the game, it truly opens up into something special, particularly once one has reached Velen in the main story-line. The game can be many things to different people, set to its lowest difficulty the game becomes a story-based narrative game with combat adding flavor to the engrossing open world, but at higher difficulties such as Blood and Broken Bones and Death March, the game begins to take on souls-like characteristics, rewarding the player for learning about and thoughtfully utilizing the deep combat and crafting systems. Blood and Bones finds itself as feeling like a souls-like hybrid, more accessible than a traditional souls-like, but still challenging and rewarding, whereas Death March integrates the punishing feel of a souls-like, forcing the player to engage with the systems in place to gain any traction in the world, rather than firmly, but not overwhelmingly simply pushing the player in their direction in the Blood and Bones difficulty.Overall though, The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece, for the right person, this sort of game really caters to someone who enjoys games that engross one with a deep story and beautifully deep RPG systems, but may not appeal to someone who is just looking for a game to pick up and play for a couple of minutes. Though if one is a new player to RPGs, I\'d highly recommend The Witcher 3 as a way to enter into the genre, particularly at lower difficulties as it allows the player to learn and engage with RPG mechanics, without them being overwhelming.Overall 10/10 game that most assuredly is worth your time.',''),(315,'One of the best game ever .

The price was quite high for the game which I have already put in ignore list but I was like heck it, you only live once. It didn\'t take much time me to buy the all DLC\'s and now, I have tested hundreds of mods and actively using 263 of those. Now I have more than 1000h played this game.The most I enjoy in this game is the multiplayer mods when those work. The game itself is really morally corrupting and hard, you make choices what you didn\'t think you\'ll never even thought was possible. All for the perfectly imperfect colonist to survive in a hostile world created by AI. Their life is a struggle sometimes and it makes the game so fascinating. One wrong choice might end up making every colonist die. When you talk about this game and take it out of context you\'ll sound like dictator with bloodlust.If this game would be fully multiplayer compatibility it would be perfect.

I haven\'t touched any mods yet but scrolling through the workshop page alone made me realize that there is a lot of stuff to mess around with. I would recommend trying out the base version of RimWorld first before buying any DLCs or adding mods, since it\'s probably best to learn how the game works before adding a bunch of stuff that makes the game more complex or that makes changes to how the game works.And no, giving prisoners some weed and booze before releasing them is not a crime - but shooting them in the back afterwards might be.',''),(331,'What I like about the game is that you start with 3 people.

With over 4,000 hours now I have witness the rise and fall of thousands of colony\'s starting up on the planet of Rim.  I think that the best DLC\'s go from BioTech to then Ideology, and then Royalty.  Biotech DLC is my favorite because you can have children, make new races, and build robots that can help your colony succeed or at the least act as a replacement for your colonist if something bonkers happens.I know that at first, some of my friends complained that the game looked really cartoony and not 3D.  I understand but I think that this allows anyone to play the game and underneath what you see is TONS of information being processes about every single pawn or object in the game.    The game is computing age, time, memories, sadness / happiness, thoughts, pain, etc. etc.  In conclusion I think that Rimworld definitely deserves a chance to be on your Library along with the DLC\'s (at least BioTech), and get MODS, there are so many mods that can further make your game exactly how you would like it to be.  If I had a 1000 copies I would give this game out just so that it could blow up even more.

Let me go through it a little bit. It doesn\'t mean that I don\'t recommend it under any circumstance, in a way it\'s actually both a very fun MMO, and a very fun solo experience. It\'s just the more I think about it, the sadder I get, so that\'s why I personally can\'t give a recommendation. The content is heavily skewed towards PvE, PvP is basically neglected.On top of that, the PvE content is heavily skewed towards dungeon content, and we are sorely missing more variety with PvE releases. - We get 1 12-man trial per year with a story zone expansion that costs like a full priced game (40 euros) for a total of 12 trials in the game as of the end of 2023;- We get 2 4-man dungeon packs with 2 dungeons each per year which cost an in-game currency equivalent of 13 euros each (and dungeons make up the majority of group content in the game now with 52 dungeons); - Once per year we also get zone DLCs that cost about as much as the dungeons and only gives you access to a new zone and item sets/antiquities that come with it;- The game only has 2 group arenas;- The game only has 2 solo arenas;- The game now has 1 solo/duo infinite dungeon that is, as you guessed it, infinite and thus reuses assets from older in-game content;- The game\'s PvP ONLY has 1 big open world PvP zone, 1 smaller PvPvE zone, and 4-player battlegrounds with only 5 play modes. PvP content hasn\'t been updated in ages, no new PvP zones or PvP modes being added;- The game is 10 years old in 2024.Releasing a mini-trial pack (of which, btw, there are only TWO out of 12 trials total) or a solo/group arena pack instead of a dungeon pack would go a long way, since if we compare the numbers, there are too many dungeons, and too little of anything else, and it gets extremely repetative. PvP is very much long due for an update, either with releasing some new PvP/PvPvE zones, or adding modes to battlegrounds.Other thoughts, in no particular order:- There are so many item sets, and most of it is just bloat, since there\'s always just about a dozen meta sets that are in use and then nothing else, and they swap around each patch based on what was added, what was buffed, what was nerfed.- Based on the above, it\'s very much possible that whatever build you are using can be rendered useless next patch, forcing you to grind the next best thing.- PvP and PvE are not balanced separately, which leads to grievances on both sides of the playerbase.- ZOS has a lovely tendency of making new classes overpowered on release (same goes for sets and mythics, tbh) and then nerfing them into near uselessness down the line (e.g. thrassian, oakensoul, necromancer and warden classes).- With the hybridisation changes playing different classes and different resources (mag or stam) feels basically the same. While it did add good quality of life, it absolutely murdered build variety.- Performance is still jank with things plainly refusing to work and bugs not getting fixed for years, or being fixed and new renditions reintroduced in newer patches (hello, block bug).- The current release schedule feels more like maintenance mode.- I don\'t want to talk about the monetisation, because it\'s another big can of worms. Just, for new people, before going to buy something off of crown store, check if you can get it in game for free or for gold first. Because I guarantee you, for most of those things you can. Yes, even the DLCs, which leads me to the next point...- The game doesn\'t have an in-game gold-crown exchange. Instead, it allows people to do such exchanges themselves (you pay gold for crown gifts, or you crown gift to get gold). So it\'s unsupervised and scam-prone, so that\'s not ideal, but it is an option if you don\'t want to pay real money for crown store goods.- Big in-game houses cost an absolutely unhealthy amount of real life money. The housing aspect of the game is quite good though sadly, the houses don\'t have any uses beside being a crafting base at best and a decoration set at worst.',''),(346,'Hours in as a new player and I have nothing hooking me or drawing me in. The weapon and talent system seems interesting, but everything just dies in a couple whacks so there\'s no excitement about leveling up or unlocking new skills. The quests are basically just running around in circles and talking to people. There\'s no sense of danger or adventure, and no calling to some higher or more interesting story.',''),(347,'I mostly play this game solo, and in 352 hours of gameplay I haven\'t touched the PVP aspect. There\'s a ton of content in this game, if rather repetitive and samey, it\'s rewarding and a great way to turn your brain off after a day of work or study.While the writing is not top-notch, it is serviceable in the sense that you can feel immersed in the world by following the events and learning more about the lore. I\'d say, though, it is weird that every other questgiver is like, \"you\'re the one I was looking for\" like you\'re the chosen one in a world where everyone else is also the chosen one.I return to this game every few months, there are usually new DLCs to check out, but mostly, I play it until I get bored or find something else to do, then months later something makes me want to play it again. I like the fact you don\'t need to keep a subscription to play, this helps because the barrier to return is low as I don\'t have to pay, but then when I really get into the groove again I re-subscribe because that way I don\'t have to buy the DLCs directly, and I get expanded inventory and bank storage, plus I save the crowns to eventually buy the DLCs and rely less on the subscription.I\'ve played many MMOs, but this one has the right mix of content that I relate to (Elder Scrolls lore), a simple yet rewarding enough game loop, and the freedom to play without paying. It makes me feel like I don\'t need to be committed to it at all times, which has often made me burn out from MMOs,',''),(348,'A lot to do and the mechanics are decent and not PTW unless if you are in to cosmetics',''),(349,'I love this game. For an old codger like me it\'s perfect. I can play when I want and how I want and not have to worry about intense play. I can just go about my business completing quests and upgrading my character. The open-world style is nice to explore and the non-player-characters are fun to interact with and hear their stories.',''),(350,'Now THIS is a true scam of extraordinary proportions. I paid for most DLC as they came out, thinking that I would have access to that content and play it, if I did not care about the extra perks the monthly subscription gave me. How wrong was I. Soon Bethesda figured out the trick with the ingredients bag. Basically when they took away the ability to use the ingredients bag without an ESO+ subscription, they made all DLC unplayable. Without the ingredients bag, the game becomes an inventory management nightmare. People have alts just to use as a chest to try to get around this problem. All the money I spent on DLC is now money thrown out the window, because I can not play any of the content I paid for without ESO+, but with ESO+ I have access to that content anyway. Needless to say, this was the last straw for me. I am done with Bethesda. This is the last dime they saw from me. I have thousands of other games to play.',''),(351,'What can I say? I\'m having fun. This late in the game there\'s a TON of stuff to do, and they look into the weirder parts of TES lore. Game is still very active.Only downside is that the resource bag is only available with subscription, and it\'s necessary for anyone with multiple characters or crafters. But if you don\'t want to keep resources (like if you know you\'re only going to make certain things so you only need to carry those certain resources), I guess you don\'t need it. And subscription gives you SO MUCH MORE than just the resource bag, so it\'s not a bad deal, exactly.',''),(352,'played for 15 min. looked great was loving it.

And really isn\'t very far from great. But they refuse to fix  a number of things that just destroy it. Mainly their skill tree mess combined with the fact that you have a maximum of like 7 skill slots at one time. And thousands of skills. And only one alternative skill bar to swap to... its a joke. A messy joke that had great potential until the devs got their heads stuck up their asses and said  \"♥♥♥♥ it, we\'re on to the next game\".All they had to do was make Morrowind MMO... Instead they jerked it around and made it into some kind of  wonky ass wanna be MMO that just has to be different. Even though it was one of the most unique RPGs out there in the first place. By refusing to copy other MMO\'s in some base functions, like having many skills you can use, they just limit their game. Not make it unique or more interesting. And in the process they forced players to conform to stupid limitations  in their builds that make creative PVP a no go, and even makes creating unique builds basically impossible. Instead of fair, or unique, they made it not fun.And they support rapist behavior online.

The maps can be so dark on console to the point where i literally couldnt make out where i was. Bhvr has also been very lazy with killer design lately where they give killers chase powers that arent one bit enjoyable.But when it comes to the base game its a love hate relationship. If they didn\'t balance the game in a competitive way it would thrive much more. But easily the biggest let down is the community. Never been told to off myself or been called slurs more than I have in dbd. I do not recommend this game. Its like heroin. You will chase that high you used to get when you first played this game.

I used to love this game putting 1000 hours per year in the first couple years I played but due to a lot of issues with the game over the last year I just can\'t bring myself to play the game anymore. I think my biggest issue with the game has how awful the community is. I\'m normally not bothered by people being rude or being toxic but this game has really gotten to me because it feels like every match is dealing with toxic players that are so full of themselves that they can\'t see anything past their own ego. You can\'t even have a decent discussion with players anymore because they refuse to see anything that isn\'t there narrow point of view no matter how outlandish it is. It\'s not just in endgame chats either its on every damn social media platform too. You can\'t go into a content creators or the official dbd accounts comment sections without seeing every annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just typing up the most toxic ♥♥♥♥ you\'ve ever seen and it just fells awful to be apart of a community that has the majority of its vocal player base just acting like children. There are a lot of good people in the community but they get trampled on by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part of the community.My other major issue is honestly the developers. This most recent AMA took the cake for me when they literally said that help for soloq is not a priority but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cosmetics are and that it would take YEARS to implement changes for soloq. If that isn\'t the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing I\'ve ever seen I don\'t know what is. There are also some killers that really need the help like myers and freddy that aren\'t even on the damn roadmap but they need to tweak demo and huntress, which it seems to me at least that the majority of the player base think are fine. Blight is finally getting his addons nerfed but it took over 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years to get him nerfed but they nerfed the addons of nemesis and twins like wtf. There are maps like red forest that have been reworked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ twice yet swamp hasn\'t yet. Map offerings make playing killer miserable now since everyone brings them and yet the devs haven\'t done anything about that. Speaking of maps we haven\'t, IMO, gotten a single good map except for Nostromo in the almost 4 years I\'ve been playing the game. I know some people are gonna mention dead dawg saloon and it\'s not a bad map, but I\'m tired of that map. The devs just like to add new stuff while not balancing or fixing current problems with the game. The amount of bugs the game still is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dumb. We just recently at the time of posting this had flashlights and perks that had to do with flashlight disabled for the 2nd time because of a bug that would allow survivors to get inside of a locker without actually being in, making it impossible to get them. That would normally lead to either the game lasting an hour and the timer kicking everyone out of the match or the killer dcing because of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ broken it was. And the saddest part is that survivors would abuse the ♥♥♥♥ out of it and some would complain if they got banned for it. I\'m not asking for a perfect game even though I know it sounds like it but it just feels like this game lost its fun. I don\'t hate dbd but i certainly don\'t like the game and want it to get better but it just seems the game is going in a bad direction and the devs don\'t seem to listen to anyone in the community that is actually trying to help. The fog whisperers, that are supposed to be the ambassadors of the game, can\'t even help make the game better since it seems that they get ignored. What\'s the point of having them then if they don\'t get to help with the game in anyway. I\'m gonna wrap this up and just say that there is pretty much no chance of me coming back to the game. I feel like if I play again I\'m gonna lose my sanity and my mental health is a bit more important then this dumb game. Also a side note if you play this game and want all the dlcs, the licensed ones that you have to buy with real money will cost you over $100 at this point and thats not including the game itself and the ones you can just buy with iri shards.Edit: One more thing is that every time a new asymm game comes out, the dbd community ruin it immediately so good luck if another game like this comes out.',''),(410,'since nobody will read the reviews, i’ll say in this review i’m gay and i love crossdressing as a femboy',''),(411,'This game is becoming a joke.

This game had great highlights and unique play mechanics and dynamics at some points. However all of these attributes were flushed down, when the ICO hit. Before these changes/updates (The core and vast community did not request), the game was in a great state and had good balance between a mil sim/arcade shooter hybrid. But now, the game is on a dying state, while the core player still lives for those \"Squad only\" moments, they are occluded by constant game mechanics that make no sense and feel like all of these soldiers are well past 80 year olds handling firearms and combat sorties. If you hate someone, gift them this game... and If someone gave you this game... THEY HATE YOU!',''),(431,'reminds me of Americas army 3 but with elements of arma.',''),(432,'I\'ve been playing this since mid 2021The game was largely fun until late September 2023 when they added the Infantry Combat Overhaul (ICO) update, since then the games just been really hard to play for regular infantry. Many people will claim \"SKILL ISSUE\" or \"GO BACK TO COD IF YOU WANT A TWITCH SHOOTER SO BADLY\" if you try to give any criticism to the update, while most others that dislike it have already abandoned the game entirely, or, like me, are trying to tough it out trying to like it and make it work.The main problem with infantry gunplay is that your gun will always be swaying, if you\'ve ever played Project Reality, supposedly this game uses the same system from that where you have 2 dots on your compass to tell you how accurate your next shot will be (The closer the 2 dots are, the more accurate your next shot will be), but the problem with this is that you can never truly get perfect accuracy, now, technically you can IF you go prone, scope in, and hold SHIFT so you\'re holding your breath ala call of duty style, but you can not move under any circumstances, otherwise your aim goes all over the place.Now, this makes sense for when you\'re on the move and if you are sprinting, your aim will, naturally and understandably, get worse, but the problem is it takes so long to recover your aim that you\'re literally having to debate between being able to run and survive, but not hit the actual broad side of a barn, or to walk, and likely risk dying, but be able to quickly react. To SOME, this is perfect gameplay and exactly what you want, and to many others, this is an okay concept, but needs heavily fine-tuning to make it work.The real problem is that the update has been tweaked to such an extreme that you struggle to actually play the game normally as infantry and most of the time you\'re getting frustrated because you can get the advantage, lay down on a higher position, aim perfectly, and still miss, you can do the most perfect setup and still fail and die to the enemies that will end up usually randomly firing back at you.This issue only gets worse depending on the faction you fight, as those who have 7.62mm guns (Primarily the fictional faction Middle Eastern Alliance (MEA) or the recently added Turkish Land Forces) can get a guaranteed 1 shot kill if you\'re too close to them, not to mention ANY weapon that IS 7.62mm will have heavily increased suppression (Which distorts your view and blurs it if a bullet shoots near to you), even a bolt action rifle, which is really bad when you consider machine guns that fire 5.56mm won\'t do the same even if you\'re firing full auto, even at close rangeSo now you\'ve got players on both sides basically firing blindly at each other sometimes, hoping someone dies first, which again, to some this is ideal and realistic, but to most this is NOT FUN GAMEPLAY and is incredibly frustrating! A lot of people will scream at you \"BUT THIS IS REALISTIC\", and while the game certainly takes a more realistic approach compared to others I won\'t deny; I would also at the same time encourage you to ignore people who treats this as a milsim or realistic in any way, as the game developers have even said this game is not a military simulator, its meant to be a bridge gap of casual and milsim like games. And this is not even addressing the many issues with \"realism\" in this game such vehicles getting stuck on the smallest rock, or how you need to fire several rockets to destroy vehicles, even lightly armoured ones, or helicopters tanking damage. So people who treat this as a milsim are treating the game a little too seriously (Especially on the steam discussions and discord, which I would discourage you from interacting in), and as such they will beat you down because \"muh realism\", look guys, I love my realism too, I play Arma 3 sometimes and I love having realistic stuff in these games, I like my tactics and strategies! But I also want something a little bit more casual but not so casual its call of duty, I don\'t want to wait several seconds between shots on SEMI-AUTO while crouching and aiming down sights to actually get target acquisition. It does not get much better if you are hip firing, as you are not likely to hit anything even if the target is right in front of you.The final straw for me on this was the developers and community management, or at least, upper management, as they seem to not be keen on taking on any of the communities feedback, there are thousands of messages in their discord, and on the steam discussions about how the ICO update has very negatively impacted the game and how it can be improved in so many ways, while the developers/management seem to be dragging their feet extremely hard, refusing to communicate with the community outside of YouTubers that already share their notion that his update was good and shouldn\'t be changed. The reality is that a lot of people actually like the idea of the ICO update but hate the execution as it is has been tweaked to such a degree you have to be camping and laying down in bushes with bipods, constantly aiming down sights holding shift all the time to actually make any meaningful progress which makes the gameplay boring and repetitive for those who do this, and frustrating for this who keep dying to these people as it is not fun gameplay. People will try to give you tips to help deal with it, and while I really truly appreciate those who do give these tips, this doesn\'t fix the issues people are having with the update.I\'ve tried to like the update for almost 3 months, but I can\'t. Its simply not fun, and at this point the development is so backwards and the community is so clearly being ignored, I\'d rather be tempted to try out Operation: Harsh Doorstep or hell even learn what it takes to make a game myself and try it, because the game has so much potential but its not being realised nor utilised, and this is on the team at Offworld Industries. It does not help that there seems to be a big push for emotes and weapon skins (likely after a large investment by Tencent), when the game is already plagued with so many bugs and issues that continue to not get fixed each update and with every update, more bugs and issues plague the game, the most recent one (V7.1) makes it practically impossible to even play on multiplayer servers!While I am all for supporting development and that to support a game as large as this for several years they need money (Despite the fact the games community ran?), theres a clear lack of priorities on the developers part.If you still want to play the game, I seriously encourage you to look up any videos on the ICO update before buying this, and wait for a free weekend, they are few and far between I won\'t deny it (1 or 2 per year) but for a game thats £40, and with games that go on for 1 - 2 hours which would easily make you inelligable for a refund, I just simply wouldn\'t encourage you to buy this unless you absolutely know what you\'re getting yourself intoI would also NOT trust the trailers much, they are somewhat scripted and while they certainly say they\'re \"tested on a live environment\" they are very much hosted on a server with only a small number of players on a separate instance on the game which isn\'t a real reflection of the gameplay you\'ll get (Especially with that PLANMC trailer where you\'ve got mortars almost hitting humvees, that just won\'t happen). You also won\'t get such intense radio chatter sound effects in game, thats been added post production.I might still play the game a fair bit, but know that I largely play helicopters and vehicles now, infantry is just straight up horrible, and considering infantry is a main part of the game, that is not something you can ignore.',''),(433,'Added micro transactions and paid DLC\'s are planned after promising to \"never add\" themDon\'t get me wrong, the game itself is amazing but this break of trust really soured my taste for the game.

The ADS is the worst thing I\'ve experienced in a game. It\'s way too slow, excessive sway, but worst of all, the eye relief is TERRIBLE!!! The optic feels like it\'s at least a foot away from your face at all times. The only thing authentic about this update is the fact that if you\'re holding the weapon a foot from your face, you won\'t have a cheek weld and won\'t ever be able to actually look through the optic. Every optic on every weapon is more of a hindrance than an asset. Can\'t say enough bad things about this update.

Mind you I am barely 5 hours in and already seeing many of the complaints. Don\'t get me wrong the new game play elements such as sliding and vaulting obstacles adds an interesting element to it all. Sadly those fun additions are overshadowed by the company\'s need to push agenda.  As a fan of pre-borderlands 3 games in the franchise this was a let down on so many levels. Game companies need to go back to focusing on a good story and fun game play instead of getting caught up in politics. This is another good example, like Sims 3, as to why I don\'t bother investing in companies anymore.To those of you wanting to say diversity and inclusion has always been part of the Borderlands franchise. Perhaps, among others for part 2 you had Axton who was bisexual and the openly gay Hammerlock. But now of the four available characters you have the traditional siren, soldier and the rest focus on pushing agenda with a non-binary robot or another bisexual who is secret agent. It\'s no longer characters who happen to be that orientation, it becomes their entire character and how they are marketed. Where is the Crazy character archetypes like Brick, Salvador or Krieg? In previous games sexual orientation wasn\'t what made the characters endearing, it was their story. It\'s no longer about making a good story but instead appeasing some agenda and when it doesn\'t perform those who didn\'t like it or didn\'t buy it are attacked verbally. Many are now just taking the advice of how it\'s not made for them so don\'t buy it yet somehow they are still the villain. Same is happening with sites like Nexusmods where it is okay for representation for one side but not the other. It\'s okay to add child killing mods, same-sex mods and whatever else is fine. But any mods that remove pronouns, change characters to be straight or gender-swap characters a certain way is a hate-crime. This hypocrisy is getting so out of hand that it has become ridiculous and makes finding decent games a challenge. This applies to both the big name companies and the smaller independent developers. Gaming really needs to go back to how it used to be with companies focusing on telling a good story rather than preaching to players about their politics. Allow the player(s) to customize their games privately for their own style or preferences if they want it a certain way.',''),(467,'When it works its decent game play. Good weapons.

The Vault Hunters this time around have interesting and fun skills, and having modifiers based on which skill tree you spec into is a great idea, Visually, the game is also massively improved, higher quality textures and a lack of PhysX do wonders for visual fidelity and performance, respectively. Although some features  don\'t work quite like they should (we\'ll get to that), the game looks quite good. Also, Sir Hammerlock and Jakobs as a gay power couple is easily the best thing in the entire game, because it actually makes sense and they are characters with serious chemistry The bad comes widely from my love of the Borderlands series. If you do not care about Borderlands, then none of this will matter to you, although I\'d question why you spend your time playing a game you dont care about lmao... Borderlands 3\'s writing is atrocious, in a series that famously has the kind of writing that a TV series in the GTA universe would have, you have to do a lot wrong to stand out. And Borderlands 3 does a lot wrong. Trying to dump the crowd that would be offended by \"girl power\" messaging in games is a noble effort, but Borderlands 3 leans so hard into that angle that it comes across as obnoxious when paired with the juvenile humor and inability to keep a consistent tone. We are talking Marvel movie tier \"comedic relief ten seconds after a tragic moment.\" The Twins are TERRIBLE antagonists, that set up something almost maybe interesting and then immediately throw that little development away. A beloved character is killed senselessly, purely for the sake of setting up one of the game\'s most unlikable characters to be some kind of future protagonist. Overall, the story is a problem, and actively discourages me from replaying the game. All of that isnt even to mention the fact that this game set up the direction of New Tales From The Borderlands, which means its responsible for the death of all things funny and good. The redesigned rarity and drop system is far too generous with Legendary weapons, and Annointments kind of ruin rare weapon drops in the first place.

Each season brings new challenges and opportunities, ensuring that the gameplay never becomes repetitive.Furthermore, the game\'s soundtrack is a masterpiece.

That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal.

There are more interesting lore elements, plot with more fun twists, way less bland dialogues (some of them genuinely made me laugh, which is an achievement for a video game writing), more appealing area design. As an overall package it is pretty hard to think of better game in the genre (except, potentially, BG3, but I will check it later). If you compare it story wise with other games, there are better alternatives for sure. The story is relatively straightforward, but still was pretty entertaining to follow.As cons I will mention several things. DOS2 can be dragging sometimes in terms of pacing, especially in the last act. I expected a bit more with \"pre-made\" characters story quests, they do make experience more engaging, they are still a bit lacking (I still recommend everyone to start the game with them, you can customize their builds however you want anyway). The game sometimes seems a bit restrictive due to necessity to find areas more appropriate for your current level. Also some fights can be too frustrating without cheese tactics.Nevertheless, still amazing CRPG, which helped to revitalize the genre (I remember everyone being doomsayers during Mass Effect days, these are in the past).',''),(510,'One of the greatest RPG game that I ever played and co-op just makes it 10 times more better.Cant wait for Baldurs Gate 3 now.',''),(511,'When you don’t know how to do this task, kill a NPC who gave you the task.',''),(512,'Awesome soundtrack',''),(513,'Its good, I like it, However it can be one giant time sink!

Rewards thinking outside of the  box.   Standard difficulty is balanced in a way that seems like you Have to cheese, rob, steal, fight dirty and have a stellar handle on status effects, buffs, nerfs combat bonuses etc.  Get ready to get your teeth kicked in when act 2 starts if you don\'t have combat totally figured out. (big part of it is status effects and denying the enemy their turns).    They let you re-spec your skills at the start of act 2, and its tuned for that. You can spend hours balancing your characters and get nuked by a status effect you never saw before then BAM, back to the drawing board (again) Its extremely well made, they knew exactly what they wanted to do and they did it but it can feel like brick wall after brick wall.

The gameplay expanded a lot compared to the first game, It nails the hacking system very well with a variety of options like: phone distraction, vehicle control, traffic control, security system shutdown, and of course, one of the best things they ever add and ever exist in a video game is planting fault evident which make the police or the gang to attack someone . You too lazy to learn the enemeis location to sneak in their base ? just call an entire SWAT team on them and they gonna create enough distraction for you to go in + I have to give the parkour system big credit for making the game movement so smooth and enjoyable . There are also variety of parkour animation , my favourite is back flip and front flip + Gun play is so so , i don\'t have much to say about it { Story } + The story is decent , not great but decent . The thing that stands out for me the most is not the actual story itself, but the interesting characters that we meet , i mean by that is my gang : Wrench, Josh , Horatio , Sitara and the main character himself Marcus  . Their personality is quite unique and the way Ubisoft show them is Amazing + Wrench with his iconic mask. He is so fun to talk to , he is hilarious always make jokes throughout the adventure, he like destroying stuff . My man having a serious problem with animal though XD+ Josh is like a depressed kid . He is quiet ,doesn\'t talk much kinda socially awkward but very smart. That doesn\'t mean he is boring , he brings a different sort of humor to the game like when he try to find out what \"cornhole\" mean XD+ Sitara is the only woman in the team , my girl is a real artist and DJ , very talented . She is the face of dedsec cause without her drawing skills dedsec have no appearance+ Horatio is kinda bland because Ubisoft some how doesn\'t  give him much screen time. He is nice and vibe dude { Audio } + Voice actiong is great+ Music is...... so so , i don\'t find myself listen much to the music in game. But it is cool that you allow to pick song to listen to all the time even in combat { Difficulty } + Gun play is balance , our health is not superior than our enemies like other game . We die like after 4 to 5 shoot and believe me ,you gonna die a lot if not careful+ Enemies AI is Smart . They don\'t just take cover and shoot back, they actually have strategy like some guys in the front keep you busy while the others rotate and try to flank you, and since you die after 4 to 5 shoot like i said, direct combat is not recommend+ Well.....Here is reason why the game is not 10/10 . It the stealth system , WHAT KIND OF GAME where one enemies spot you even just for 0.1s after you take him down, the entire army knew exactly where you are and jump on you. { PC requirement } + You need a decent laptop/pc to run this game { Game time } + pretty long ( 17h-30h ){ Bugs } + i don\'t see any bug { Final thought } + There are still a ton of thing i haven\'t talk about like normal NPC AI , NPC dialogue , Car physics and stuff.....But This game is good and for me it is the best game Ubisoft ever create',''),(531,'W',''),(532,'There is a game breaking bug that basically locks content you paid for with no fix.

I was a teenager when it came out so I didn\'t have the money to buy a PC that could properly run Skyrim, so I played it on my Xbox 360. I played my first main save for years, completing literally every quest available (except for the ones that were bugged and couldn\'t be finished) and the only reason I ever stopped playing was because my save files began to get corrupted, and even then I still tried to play and just avoid the corrupted areas up until I just couldn\'t anymore.Throughout that whole time, I watched YouTubers like MxR showcase Skyrim mods on PC that amazed me. When they re-released Skyrim on Xbox One and allowed us to download a select mods, I played through again and had a blast, but I knew I was missing out on the true modded experience. Things like SKSE, SkyUI, ENBSeries, and other mods/tools that simply couldn\'t be ported over were still out of my grasp, not to mention the absolutely absurd mod limit that prevented me from using all my favorites at once.Flash forwards to this year, when I saved enough money to buy a PC that could run games well, and I could finally play around with all those mods that I grew up watching. I spent two weeks selecting mods, tweaking settings, and fixing load orders. Last week on Monday I finally had it set up and I was ready to play. But guess what happened when I tried to launch? Crash to Desktop. I knew it wasn\'t my mods since I was very selective, so I was very confused. Then I saw it. Bethesda updated Skyrim. Again. And broke the most important mods out there. I was hopeful at first, thinking there was maybe some new content or some MUCH NEEDED bug fixes. But no. It was paid mods. PAID MODS. You guys broke some of the oldest and most important mods that the community has loved for the past ten years just to try and steal some more money out of our pockets and shove paid mods down our throats.Remember what happened last time, Bethesda?

I opened the game a couple of months ago and found that I could not get a playable frame rate and good-enough graphics at the same time, which was weird, because I did not have any problems before, so I forgot about the game again for a while. I now have the Steam Deck OLED, which has slightly better all round performance, and find that the situation has not changed.When I used to play, I tried to do so as \"authentically\" as possible - no HUD, no glowing tracks etc, no assists, no ATV (which are all cheating), and limited fast travel, and I had a great time. I finished the entirety of Yukon Valley, maybe half of all Rancho content, maybe half of Cuatro Colinas content, and bits of other maps, using 3 weapons packs, the bloodhound, and the tents DLC.

I have spent a lot of time in Spain in real life, and Quatro Colinas has areas and views that are distinctly evocative of parts of Spain.It is annoying that you have to download the entire new DLC map when one is released, whether you will buy it or not, which really eats away memory card space (about 10GB per map, which is not nothing). The justification is that you can play all maps for free on other peoples\' servers, but I would rather have the 50GB+ of disk space from the 5+ maps that don’t interest me at all.The “plot” of each area is mostly just ways to try to justify gunning down the various species in the name of “conservation” or “population control”; in reality, the best technique is to re-establish top predators (typically having been wiped out by hunting), not to kill them. And the other kind of mission story tends to be improving facilities for the rich hunters who pay to hunt in the area, though you never see them.Notably, the free trophy lodge that they added a few months ago is absolutely atrocious, apart from the view. I wish I could get a refund for it. I just thought I\'d mention that.The African trophy lodge is OK but I would wait until you have a good number of actually-worth-displaying trophies before paying for a trophy lodge, or you will end up with mostly-empty rooms.It\'s obviously not a perfect simulation, but it\'s a good tracking and shooting game, and a great price when on sale.

In a game with otherwise very nice sound design and foley this is a huge shame and it causes real problems in gameplay. The game does have a visual indicator thing that shows where sounds are coming from, and this is basically essential otherwise you would end up looking in the wrong direction when you hear an animal. It\'s especially annoying with the dog\'s barking when they\'re tracking an animal, I generally have to bring up the GPS map thing to see where he actually is.It seems like these this issue with audio spatialisation has been reported for many years now and it hasn\'t been fixed, this really isn\'t great.It\'s mostly solid otherwise though one bug that keeps happening for me is the weapon and all gear seemingly disappearing from my hands when I make certain inputs in fast sequence, and I have to go into the inventory to unequip/equip to bring it all back so I can use a gun etc. If this happens at a critical moment as an animal is passing by it kind of kills my enthusiasm for the game tbh.Hopefully this stuff gets sorted sooner rather than later because I really like the game and would like to play more.',''),(569,'dont waste your time with this game, spent thousands of hours on it between console and pc and my honest view is that this game has had so many changes come to the game for the better that instead of being apart of the base game are instead DLC, such ATV\'s, Tents, Dogs, hunting equipment such as stand/tripods and EVERY SINGLE HUNTING RESERVE except layton lake and hirschfelden (7/10 maps imo) are all payed DLC. 75% of real hunting equipment IRL for hunting water fowl are payed DLC aswell, most common effective hunting calibers arent even in the base game such as 6.5, 30-06, .300win, 7mm, unless you pay for the gun packs which are all separate instead of a bundle of course. The hunting experience of the game is a joke too, most of it just boils down to sprinting around everywhere with my ar-15 getting withing 200yd and just blasting as many deer as i can in order to get higher level deer to spawn, and because the AI is so borked they dont even care im shooting at them and will eventually walk back to that same spot were i shot them 3 minutes later. and alot of the time  higher level deer like \"diamonds\" spawn and sometimes they will just run out of bounds de-spawning themselves or just not allowing you to get them, rarely if you kill an taxidermy animals they just wont count as trophy\'s and wont be mountable but ive had this happen, sill gun and arrow physics are pretty fun like for instance my 450gr broadhead being able to travel through an entire cape buffalo length wise lmaooverall the lighting and weather of the game is what sells it but the overall graphics are a 6/10 but there not nearly as bad as say a game like the hunter classic, but for a game that came out in 2017 is expect better. and the story is terribly boring, you play as a no name hunter came to get as many diamond trophies as you can and overall the game is just chasing dialouge no real events, the most fun story i played was the \"vurhonga savannah\" cause i thought the characters *even though you never see faces* were interestingOverall if you want to play a hunting game that has good hunting mechanics and good animal behavior AI, aswell as a wide variety of the most commonly used hunting calibers and an experience with good graphics aswell as story. there are better options that dont cost nearly as much money as buying this game and all its DLC. i recommend \"way of the hunter\" its a 8/10 experience in my opinion that is simply superior to the experience i had in the hunter COTW. this games trophy hunting and animal slaughtering with my friends will always hold a special place in my heart',''),(570,'You need to buy 20 DLCs to actually be able to play the game.

It has beautiful scenery, and delivers exactly what it promises; a satisfactory - factory building game. If you enjoy building factories and redoing them over and over again, this is the game for you.My lack of enjoyment comes from the shear amount of time it takes to rebuild each factory after you learn just a bit more, or unlock alternate recipes for a component/material etc. It also seems a little insane that each new tier of factory/item to be produced takes seemingly 2x-4x the previous tier of item/building to produce in any reasonable amount of time. For example, a tier 5 building might take 100 factories of your base tier to achieve an equivalent production value/rate. Add in a map that has way too much terrain variance and obstacles, and a pretty un-intuitive conveyor system (if you want it to be organized at all) and it is just frustrating.This game is definitely a challenge and I can see why many like it, but I do not. If you are on the fence, I highly recommend buying on sale.

I expect in future updates when the bugs are addressed that I will update this review to state that it\'s become my favorite game of all time.As it currently stands, Satisfactory is unplayable for us. It started with an invisible conveyor belt that could not be interacted with or removed, but had collision. It escalated to frequent single-user crashes when using hypertubes for travel. It began affecting vehicles, with frequent single-user crashes while driving. We\'ve now encountered \"the last straw\". I just spent all evening building a factory I was intensely proud of, only to have a splitter go invisible with collision. It acted like a barrier, stopping all products from being conveyed beyond it, and it could not be removed. Worse, nothing it touched could be removed to work around the spot without causing the entire server to crash, disconnecting both of us and losing any progress since the last autosave. Additionally, at this stage, there isn\'t a large modding community or body of knowledge online that would help resolve or work around the issues.We have been having some of the best gaming experiences of our lives in this game, but the rate at which we\'re encountering gamebreaking bugs makes the current build (update 8) unplayable.

In summary I have found the experience enjoyable with quite a few exciting moments along the way. There are quite a few negative reviews for this game. As someone who\'s only ever played post 1.5, and as someone who never played the predecessor, I don\'t really share the complaints. The game works fine, the war system does what I want it to (I actually found it rather cool and well-suited to the game), and I had a fun time playing. At the end of the day, the game is a pretty solid financial / geopolitical similator set in the Victorian era and I can only recommend it if those topics are of any interest at all. As a side note, I believe this is the first time ever I have finished a full campaign in a Paradox game. Thumbs up from me!',''),(607,'I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone but the most diehard grand strategy fans.In it\'s current state Victoria 3 is an alpha game priced at 50 euro strewn with bugs and obviously missing features which Paradox will sell as exorbitantly priced \"DLC\"s years after the game\'s release. For example foreign investment mechanics are totally absent: according to Paradox these will be added later alongside an expansion - which is strange because you can download totally free user made mods that add foreign investment to the game right now. Go to the Steam Workshop, search it up, hit subscribe, and you\'re good. If some random guy can add foreign investment to the game as a little hobby project then how come a professional team of veteran video game developers can\'t? The answer is that they can. They just aren\'t allowed to by their corporate overlords.That\'s all too often the modus operandi of this company. Release a half finished, broken mess of a game, then slowly fix it while demanding hundreds of euros for \"expansions\" to turn it into what it should\'ve been at launch.With that said you might wonder why I have so many hours in this game if I don\'t recommend it. That\'s because the game\'s foundation is solid, and as it\'s essentially based around watching numbers go up It\'s  entertaining.  It\'s  addicting.  It\'s  unique.  That\'s why you can play it without being bored. It is not, however,  good.  Diplomatic plays is a fine concept, but why are they so limited and restrictive? Why can\'t we interact with our puppet states? Why aren\'t power blocs or crises a thing? The production (of goods) and building system is solid, but why can\'t we do foreign investment? Why can\'t factory owners control their factories\' production methods? Why can\'t we stockpile resources (for example to prepare for wartime)? War is a critical component of any grand strategy game and is present in a somewhat useable form, but why is there no evolution of how war plays out (pitched battles evolving into trench warfare, for example)? Why can\'t you field more than two ship types in a navy at the same time? Why has the issue of frontlines splitting and being left undefended (which can easily cost you months of ingame progress) still not fixed? Why are battles just aggregate numbers fighting aggregate numbers without any nuance? Why is the system so arcane and opaque? And why is the UI so lackluster, confusing, and ugly despite Paradox having a decade+ of experience designing them? Why are internal politics so bland and gamey? I could go on and on and on but you get the point. The foundation is solid but there\'s little more than a wooden shack built ontop of it.And oh my God the performance is atrocious.  Even on a powerful machine (beyond the game\'s recommended specs) the game slows to a snail\'s pace past 1900 (one-third of the game\'s timeframe!). Past 1920 it\'s essentially unplayable.As a silver lining I will say that the game has improved significantly since its launch, especially regarding the warfare system and non-player economics. And don\'t get me wrong: I don\'t want this game to fail. I don\'t want this company to fail. I really, really, really want this game to be good. Because there is so much potential here. But it isn\'t good. It\'s far from good. It\'s a buggy, unfinished, flavorless, directionless mess of a game that future promises and duct tape fixes cannot excuse.Don\'t buy this game.

I had been watching it since the messy release and waiting for an opportunity to arrive where it was in a state where I felt I would enjoy the hell out of it. I\'ve always enjoyed pretty much all of the Paradox suite of games, but I\'d say this one has very quickly become my favorite. I love the simulation this game delivers, and the alt-history silliness that can happen. I\'ve made an ultra-capitalistic Presidential Republic Spain, a militarist Sokoto Caliphate, and most recently I had a blast with Japan achieving the Meiji Restoration achievement.Normally, I hate randomly generated systems in games with almost no exceptions, however, V3 has somehow achieved a way to make it feel fair. The events that are purely bad don\'t linger for too long, or they are there to present a reasonable challenge. The difficulty varies all over, and I wholeheartedly appreciate it. The challenging starts that I\'ve tried genuinely feel fun, for example: Egypt is a race against time to build up military to defend against an eventual Ottoman attack, and I\'m not good enough yet to figure out how to do it without ruining my run. I actually enjoy playing all the way through to the end when in EU4 I\'ve only ever done that once. The soundtrack is absolutely without a doubt my favorite soundtrack in all of the Paradox suite of games.

I guess it\'s a good economy simulator, but this is not the legendary grand strategy game we were promised. While the idea of having general\'s lead a war sounds cool, it DOES NOT WORK.

If you just want to look at some number or take some action you have to click through a bunch of menus, some of which you need to scroll to reach what you need. It\'s more like a menu simulator rather than a game.

The gameplay mechanisms of the game are dysfunctional despite the promises that the developer want to promote to the public. You will start to fall in love with the premise of the game until a series of minor bugs start to plague your gaming experience. I won\'t deny that the game has unique and innovative features such as the comprehensive economic system which makes the game akin to a spreadsheet simulator, but there\'s so much untested features that makes you unable to enjoy the game. The most guilty feature that Victoria 3 has is the military/war system. It offers you:|- incredibly random and game-crashing frontline system- naval-invasions-that-take-forever-to-launch- interface that does not reveal you the real offense/defense value of your troops- extremely buggy occupation system where you can occupy vast territories the size of United Kingdom with only pure infantry within a few days if left undefended- AI puppet troops ruining your occupation by sending their men into suicide rushes\\- AI puppet troops only seem to be the one fighting losing battles with poor offense/defense values while your troops can\'t enter battles thus you are slowly pushed back on the frontline-  no disabling naval invasions- extremely shallow attrition system where you take attrition in your own home territory- troops in territory HQ can defend the mainland and islands at the same time so you can\'t invade islands- non existent supplies so Qing can flood Borneo with 1 million soldiers without any supply issues- most casualties of war occur from attrition until it becomes a whopping 70% of the total casualties... the list goes on.For the most part, a lot of the other bugs are harmless or a little bit annoying such as Wallachia spamming your screen with a unification message. Either way, this game is mostly unplayable if you wanna play with military expansion. The most I could do to enjoy this game with its unique features is to just be pacifist.

Very nice game play mechanics but totally hate the unnecessarily complex puzzles. It sucked at launch but after so many updates its very good.',''),(628,'It sucks to write this, but this game feels like an overall downgrade to the first Dying Light. The parkour in particular is worse than it\'s predecessor. Specifically, parkour feels more floaty and cumbersome, and inputs (at least on keyboard+mouse) are glitchy.From an atmospheric standpoint, the game doesn\'t feel like it\'s been well thought out? It feels out of place that there\'s a mob of human bad guys casually standing 15 feet away from a large group of zombies and that the two groups never interact with each other - especially when the zombie group has special infected. It feels like they simply inserted \"enemies\" for the sake of enemy density/difficulty.One of the main points of the game is to be outside during the day, and to not go into indoor structures during that time as all the volatile infected and such inhabit them. However, volatile\'s will still occupy indoor places even when it\'s nighttime, thereby making loot and/or questing those areas difficult and/or impossible. This hurts the most early on when you have no items/skills.There\'s more loot to equip in this game like a chest piece, shoes, sleeves, etc, with stat bonuses to make your character better. The loot you find is tied to your characters power level, and the higher the power level the better quality the loot. The stat bonuses are basic, and overall the systems in place for loot and itemization feel tacked on.The voice acting is decent, and the developers tried having more meaningful dialogue/plot*. Sadly, it\'s overlooked by the overwhelming amount of time spent doing the things in the game that make you question why the things that were fun in the first game don\'t feel as good in the sequel.Get it when it\'s on sale I guess if you\'re a big fan of the first game.EDIT: Beat the game, the story takes a massive nose dive after a certain point, so the previous positive thing I had to say about this game now has an asterisk.

Will update when I have played on a more recent version.I had enough fun with this game. But I had to force myself to finish the story.

I do recommend it, but be aware that it is not so much an improvement over Dying Light 1 as simply \"another\" Dying Light game. I also had a bug with a quest that I could not finish despite multiple updates, I was never able to return a certain item to the yellow marker, and that issue remained until I finished the game.The story and dialog were also boring as fu**, honestly, and I found myself skipping entire chunks of it because I could simply not give a single sh**.

I put a good amount of hrs into my first play-through and thoroughly enjoyed it. It had its shortcomings, mainly in story/missions but overall was a blast to play. Fast forward a few years later came the announcement of Dying Light 2 and I couldn\'t have been more excited. Now that I\'ve actually beat it...I can say this is a very big disappointmentBy no means would I call Dying Light 2 necessarily a bad game though, it\'s just one that feels like a major downgrade compared to the first and given that the first is 8 years old now, that\'s not good. I do love the graphics of this game as it\'s downright gorgeous and on top of that PC performance outside of a few hitches/stutters runs pretty damn smooth. Parkouring is just as addictive as ever and the main focus of traversal throughout the game and beating up zombies is definitely satisfying but that\'s really all I can say. Basically it\'s areas improved upon the first in some ways but very minuscule and the areas they really missed on why people loved the original were monumental missteps. I swear the devs completely misunderstood what made the first game so beloved. First off, why did they feel the need to add this arbitrary rpg system for the game with useless level items for weapons and equipment? Let me tell ya, the gear levels make hardly any difference at all. The introduction of inhibitors to level stamina/health instead of just upgrading skills is also beyond stupid on top of the fact most can only be found at night.Speaking of night, until a recent update night/day were barren and had no zombies or special infected. So what\'s the solution? Let\'s now make nighttime so filled with volatiles it\'s almost impossible to maneuver around without a chase. Also in regards to skills, who\'s bright idea was it to make the skills this insanely grindy to level? It\'s a singleplayer game, co-op with friends, there\'s no PVP mode so what benefit is there to making this such a chore? For context, it took me roughly 20 hrs to unlock all skills in the original. After beating Dying Light 2 with 28hrs put in, I still have about 10 skills on both parkour and combat and funnily enough the skills in this game seriously lack any impact to overall gameplay and are quite boring again where as the first really changed the game. This game also suffers immensely from Ubisoftitus where the game has hundreds of activities to do but they\'re the same cookie cutter copy and paste things you see in every game to date with little to no variation. It\'s boring and lazy. The real killer of this game though is just how miserable the writing, questing, and characters are. I\'ll admit the original didn\'t exactly have a fantastic story but I least enjoyed Crane and Jade and her brother were decent characters as well. Side quests in the original too were also a lot more fun. I opted to pretty much avoid side missions in this as they all tendto play out the same and were just non-stop fetch quests. The main missions don\'t fair much better with long drawn out sections mindless climbing and dull action. However, what drags this game completely is the characters and writing. Seriously, I don\'t like a single character here! The motivations don\'t match nor are any of them likeable! Lawan especially is one of the worst written female characters I\'ve experienced in quite some time. The endings though are truly the main problem as it\'s quite honestly terrible regardless which one you get AND is pretty much a really bad ripoff of The Last of Us ending. There\'s just too many convenience\'s within the story, characters showing up, god awful plot twists (seriously that ending plot twist is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid! 28 hrs for that twist is laughable). Forgot to mention too the final boss battle with Waltz is HORRENDOUS! I cannot believe a boss battle this bad made it into the final product.I had some enjoyment with it but this is a pretty miserable sequel in comparison to the first which I love and even played recently and still found 1000x better. So no, I don\'t recommend this as it\'s just boring as hell, a chore to play, and written so poorly. I can only see it being worth it if playing with friends for co-op purposes but in truth, there is a ton of better co-op options than this. It\'s not terrible per say but it\'s certainly not that good either. Keep in mind I played this solo so its issues are far more pronounced where I feel it\'d definitely be more tolerable with friends.',''),(634,'This game will make you go mad with things like:-NPCs teleporting when you\'re going too fast (for example running :))-An average of 3 cutscenes per minute in story quests-Game requiring all people in the lobby to open doors (which are cutscenes) in story quests-Cutscenes where the only thing you do is open the door-Parts between cutscenes where all you do is walk 200 meters in a straight line until you hit another cutscene-A lot of network issues-Everything glitching out-Coop progress is saved only on host save (quest progress)-Story making absolutely no sense-NPCs teleporting in general',''),(635,'Boring',''),(636,'Kyle crane isn\'t in this one... 0/10',''),(637,'the first one is far superior',''),(638,'Broken game.

Developed with a keen eye for detail and a love for strategic gameplay, Phantom Brigade stands out as a shining gem in the realm of \"I plan; then I go\" tactics.\"I plan, I go\" (or \"we plan/we go\" is a game mechanism where your moves are planned out in short bursts of time.  Once your movement, defense, and attack plans are complete; they are executed in real-time in an armor-shredding display of destruction.  This mechanism was pioneered by strategic games like Combat Mission and developed with a more tactical focus by games like Shadow Tactics and Frozen Synapse. This mechanic injects a thrilling dose of unpredictability into every encounter, keeping players on the edge of their seats as they meticulously plan their moves and witness them unfold in real time. The result is a harmonious blend of strategy and action that feels refreshingly dynamic.Although not taken to the nth degree, the game\'s commitment to realism extends to its destructible terrain, a feature that adds a layer of depth to battles. Watching buildings crumble and landscapes transform in the wake of intense firefights between lumbering tanks and towering mechs, adds a visceral and immersive quality to the gameplay, making each skirmish feel like a true battleground.The arsenal of weapons available in Phantom Brigade is nothing short of impressive. From beam lasers to energy swords and railguns, the game provides a satisfying variety of tools for players to customize their mechs and adapt to different challenges. Crafting and a technology tree further enhance the strategic depth, allowing for meaningful decisions and specialization as you progress.  Do you want stealth at the sacrifice of speed? The decisions are yours.The heart of Phantom Brigade lies in its ability to let players assemble and control large mechs. Managing pilots and fine-tuning these colossal war machines adds a layer of personalization and attachment that makes victories all the more satisfying. The liberation of territories, rendered with great graphics, becomes a visual feast as your mechs stomp through landscapes, toppling trees, and leaving destruction in their wake.In conclusion, Phantom Brigade is a triumph in the world of tactical gaming. It\'s a great blend of established gameplay mechanics, destructible terrain, diverse weapon selection, lite crafting, meaningful technologies, and solid graphics.  Phantom Brigade is a great choice for fans of strategic depth and immersive mech combat.

I\'m on cloud 9.For all the people on X fka Twitter and Reddit asking if it\'s still worth to play in 2023. Yes, totally. This game is just so insanely good. Gear progression is so satisfying. (don\'t you dare skip that part with Fatalis/Plunderblade exploit)Learning Monster patterns, finding openings and exploiting them with your weapons is so rewarding.Learning weapons and picking up new ones is always fun. Theres also the perfect amount of downtime you can enjoy after heated hunts. Contemplating your latest failures while gathering some honey to cool down. Chefs kiss. Exploring the maps, finding secrets, doing research or deliveries. Capturing Wildlife or even being extremely lucky and finding the shiny ultra rare Wildlife. Unlocking decorations for your personal room which you can litter with the Wildlife and Trophies you found along the way.  Buy the game already!So many little tricks to learn, practice and skills to hone. Weapons are generally easy to pick-up but have \"hidden\", or rather not so obvious tricks you can explore, exploit and master. Utilizing your knowledge of a monster and going in with a new weapon just to obliterate said monster with the arsenal of tricks you build up feels unbelievably satisfying. People who never played Monster Hunter and think the gameplay looks like Soulslikes and thus comparing the weapons to Soulslike combat usually don\'t have an understand of how complex and fun these weapons are in comparison. At least in my totally unbiased and based opinion. Guard-pointing, iFrames, counters, weapon gauges to manage, kinsects. Combos, canceling combos into finishers, clutch claw shenanigans... and so much more. 9.99/10 melee combat. 12/10 unironically industry leading animations. And don\'t get me wrong.. I like soulslikes. I have over 300 hrs in DS3 and ER combined.But something about these weapons.. they just have the perfect weight and feel to it. The differences between a heavy 2hand Greatsword or a Sword and Shield that transforms into a huge Battle Axe compared to some Dual Dagger, your more typical Sword and Shield or the Insect Glaive are like day and night. The weight and Impact of heavy weaponry feels so overpowering and the nimbleness of the light weapons will turn you into a literal acrobat dancing across the battlefield. All the animations also are truly top of the line industry leading. Oh.. and for me, a masochist, somebody who loves to clutch and to continuously improve on my playstyle... there is a great speed-running community, which still seems pretty active and will inspire you to become better. You think you know your weapon? You have over 100 hunts with that bad boy? You feel pretty confident in your abilities? Oh boy. Buckle up buddy, because you\'re in for a ride. Go check out some speedruns with your weapon of choice and you feel like you\'re back to square one. It\'s crazy how some people can script these fights, perfect knock-down chains at the exact right moment, mix and match their combos perfectly and exploit every move the Monsters can throw at you. aaamayzin.

The world and character is so beautiful (but gender lock).Many thing to do aside from killing millions of same species of monster to progress your gear.You can also killing another millions of same species to grind treasure items(Infinite Pots, Merchant Ring, Compass, Maps, Telescope etc) or something like Lifeskilling, train your loli to play instrument, getting bigger ship.BUT If you appreciate your time. Don\'t! You must be ready to wasting your precious time and coping with losing resources. You can lose your sweaty grind progress by keep gambling on enhancing equipment and If you died while grinding, it might end up with crystal lose which usually cost 30 mins - 2 hrs of your efficient grind (This might big turnoff for new player) Too many different items with different categories that fills your inventory that are either useless forever, useless for you now or only useful when its event and with you are having a limited storage (Can increase it by P2W or keep playing the game) and your slaves put the their works too into the same storage, it is so messy. I\'m remind you, don\'t trying to sort it, you better play any storage simulator games. It is make Minecraft sorting like a child play.The Progress system is one of the worst.It is like,your checkpoint for each progression 8-12-15-30-55-7000-125000your silver gain per progression 6-7-8-8-9-10-15and you are either spend 70 hours to just progress single things or you can gambling to 50/50 of either go to moon or hours of your life taken.Talk about gamble,This is one of the core of the game, the games encourage you to do this or the system is based on this.The game is full with [according to a set of probability] and events with 1) chances to drop something.2) chances for something to appear.3) chances to get a box that comes with a probability to get something.3) chances to drop a materials that are a part to craft something that needed to do a chances of something.I already touch about chances of enhancing and I don\'t want to talk about chances to drop something while grinding.Basically, if you have no luck, this game isn\'t for you. You are just hurting yourself.Lets talk about P2W,First of all, you need 1) Campsite (You will hate grinding without this)2) Horse Trumpet for horse calling (You will hate moving around the world without this)3) Pets (You can get 1b/hr in some spots but you got 500m only? you think you suck but you stop to loot because your pet suck)For point 3, middle finger to people said \"You can get pets just by playing, I play this game and all of my pet already max without spending a cent\". Tell to them, how long does its take? how many events? How lucky they are?. 5 pets without all at least Tier 3 is still bad and I\'m sure all mission that you do won\'t give you this. You need to at least play 3-4 Event that hopefully have a reward provides a chances to get a pet and of course be lucky to get it.4) Maids and Weight (Both are annoying if you just start the game, but not too significant as points above)5) Value Pack (Think this like a subscription, but you won\'t feel it till reaching mid-game, you know how bad storage system? without this, even worst)You might doing something wrong that will lose you a billions of silvers or getting a wrong progressing gear or wrong class to play but if you already started to play and enjoy it currently. Treasure it. The core of the game is about grind grind grind and gamble and there is also another way to enjoy it. just trying to motivate yourself to grind and reach your goals or sometime take a break and playing casually.

Hunt: Showdown is decidedly one of the most unique games on the market; there truly is nothing else like it and Crytek have struck gold in concept. Despite this - the current state the game is in makes it an unbelievably un-enjoyable experience. First we will address the hot topic on everyone\'s minds; the game is currently experiencing an overwhelming power creep. While respectable of Crytek to not be afraid to try new things, every addition they make tips the scales of balance more and more out of control and negates any risk and reward players may experience during their trips into the bayou. What I mean by this is they are saturating the game in a way that makes the PVP experience less of a test of skill and more of a \"Okay what ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ am I going to die to this game?\". Centennial high velocity? Dolch dum dum? Officer carbine dum dum? I\'m nothing special at this game (5 stars, 1.55 KD) but I have enough experience to know how trash PVP feels currently. It\'s bloated and does not accurately express a player\'s skill. This new system for buying tiered hunters and free hunters has also null and voided the economy and taken away the reward for extracting.Speaking of not accurately expressing a players skill... The MMR system in this game is absolutely pointless and unpolished. This isn\'t entirely Crytek\'s fault as the average player count Hunt has just might not be enough data to have an accurate spread but surely there can be something better than this. I\'d love to have a no skill based MM system back like we used to have. Forcing players to que into SBMM encourages them to play like sweatlords or rats and this game really does not fit that kind of mentality. This isn\'t an E-sport and certainly isn\'t in a state to be considered a \"competitive\" shooter. Never the less, people are so obsessed with those little white diamonds on their screens that they decide it\'s best to sit in a bush for 15 minutes instead of... oh I dunno... playing the video game? Next I want to address the servers... they are incredibly inconsistent. I understand that Crytek don\'t own their servers and presumably that means they can\'t do maintenance or upgrade the servers they rent but good lord is ping abusing/interp horrible in this game. The servers are so disconnected from what is happening on player\'s clients that Crytek made the \"genius\" executive decision to add a .8 second window where the client could send information to the server out of sync with an opposing client. Yes, I\'m talking about trading. If on my screen I shoot you in the head, but within .8 seconds you shoot me in the head it doesn\'t matter who actually shot first, the server will digest both of our inputs simultaneously and register them at the same time. This mechanic has consistently stopped new players from returning to the game as they feel they\'re just wasting their time on a game that doesn\'t respect their skill. I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve traded with someone and the death log will say I killed them at 5:00 and they killed me at 5:01. I clearly reacted and hit the shot first but Crytek has decided to allow others the crutch. \"Ah, at least we traded.\". Coming next year Crytek has announced they will be porting to the newest version of Cryengine and that their contract with the servers they\'re renting is ending. Apparently this new engine update will be so substantial that calling it \"Hunt 2.0\" isn\'t a far stretch. If Crytek are truly able to breathe life into this game in a way we haven\'t seen before with this new engine I will gladly play this game for years to come. If not, I can\'t see myself supporting it anymore.',''),(726,'It\'s a very good shooter, but... it\'s difficult.

I\'m still going to come back to this game like its an abusive on-again/off-again relationship, but if you\'re getting into the game for the first time, just know Crytek cares more about catering to hackers willing to buy the game/skins over, and over than they care about a regular player.

In den meisten Fällen Adde ich die Leute und frage mal nett nach warum man es macht, und als Antwort kommt meistens \"Ich Cheate nicht, ist ein Fehler vom Game\". Das sowas in einem PvP Shooter überhaupt möglich ist finde ich katastrophal. Auch das man Filter nutzen kann um besser sehen zu können macht das ganze nicht gerade besser. Das zeugt von schlechter Qualität und macht die PvP Eindrücke und Erfahrungen deutlich schlechter. Stattdessen wird die Community monatlich mit Dlcs, Skins und Events versorgt.

The tasks sometimes felt like mini-games of Minecraft, which seemed somewhat childish. Moreover, the game is plagued with bugs and texture issues, which, despite the patches released, remain problematic six months post-launch. These bugs also affect the boss fights, making them monotonous and predictable.However, the game\'s storyline deserves special mention – engaging, with an impressive final. The unique references to Soviet songs and the overall soundtrack add a special charm to the experience. The efforts of the Russian developers, despite a limited budget, are commendable. The graphics, while not next-gen, are still visually pleasing. The musical accompaniment, especially the techno versions of Soviet songs, adds a unique allure to the game.I rate this game 8 out of 10, with an additional point for including a song by Muslim Magomaev, which particularly bribed my Azerbaijani heart :DI recommend this game to all who like this kind of genre.',''),(801,'Great game, will definitely sink many more hours into this and play this and it\'s DLC to completion. But at the same time, it has so many small problems that make it so much less enjoyable.First off all, if you don\'t have a QWERTY keyboard and would like to play with KBM, you\'re already screwed. You\'d think you could just rebind the keys and get on with the game, but selecting dialogue options is for some reason impossible. Only way to resolve this is by changing your keyboard layout to QWERTY in your OS settings, which is not the hardest of fixes but it\'s a little bit silly that we are required to change stuff in our OS just to play the game. You could also use a controller, but imo that doesn\'t work well for this kind of game.Next, I\'ve never experienced motion sickness playing a video game. But this game loves to toss the player around and flip them upside down. I got motion sickness for the first time because of this game, which is really annoying. If you get motion sick easily, this game might not be for you.The game is also very sexual. That would be fine with me, it\'s an artistic design choice and I normally don\'t mind this at all. To each their own, but less than 2 hours in and it got to the point where it\'s honestly creeping me out.This game does have a lot of potential. A game that feels a lot like RE but in a futuristic robot apocalypse sounds exactly like my kind of game. But if you\'re used to the combat in RE against all the slower zombies, fighting against those quick and nimble robots might take some time to get used to.

The transformation of BBR into a \"live-service game\" due to these changes is the primary reason I cannot recommend it.It is evident that BBR initially launched as a nearly finished product, drawing significant inspiration from the Battlefield series. It offered a refreshing, low-render take on solid gameplay mechanics that accommodated a wide range of playstyles. However, as the game approaches its 1.0 release, the updates have aggressively extended past the publishers roadmap and have become sweepingly balance-breaking, meta-shifting, playstyle-killing, gameplay focused changes.The developers have shown a lack of sympathy when implementing changes that isolate playstyles not aligned with their current vision of BBR. These changes in no way resolve the more substantial issues the game is currently experiencing, such as the unstable and janky vehicle platform that has been ongoing since launch.What these updates have accomplished is limited and narrowed the range of gameplay options, promoting a Skinner-box gameplay model. This involves removing gameplay options that could hinder the reward seeking behavior designed to keep players constantly engaged, alienating those who purchased the game for the liberties its Battlefield-like roots originally offered.These changes lead me to believe that the developers have shifted away from their initial Battlefield inspiration. Instead, it seems they are now focused on creating a game space that maximizes cheaply retaining players attention and opening opportunities for monetization. This shift is evident in their recent \"deal\" and in-game advertisements featuring the United States Air Force. Irrespective of your preferred play style, the updates this game has experienced have been so drastic that it no longer resembles the game I initially purchased. Updates since launch have gradually undermined various playstyles, rendering them virtually unapproachable.The developers have proven themselves very capable at launching a title, but they are objectively deficient at understanding a live environment, incremental change, and multiplayer balance at a fundamental level.',''),(825,'To Devs: Please stop listening to twitch/discord/reddit/whatever social media for game feedback.

It was a game similar to battlefield 2 with a great mix of play styles and team based tactical combat. The original idea for the game was a Milsim light squad based shooter (apparently).

Sniping and long range combat has been nerfed to pointlessness.

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Communication, adaptability, and inter-unit cooperation is key to winning and you will NOT be able to run n\' gun like you can on a game like CoD or Battlefield. Solo players are best advised to find a squad and either join or request to join and pay attention to the designations. A squad that shows the \'mic preferred\' option will probably want you to have one, likewise a squad marked as \'logistics\' probably isn\'t the best choice to get stuck in the ♥♥♥♥ on the front lines.The community is one of the most open and welcoming but also the most adamant about their gatekeeping.New players are more than welcome and the vets are usually fairly happy to teach if you\'re willing to learn, and the more interested in the finer mechanics and gameplay the more likely you are to succeed. Chances are if you hop in wanting a high K/D ratio or to play one-man-army with a sniper role or in a tank you\'ll be hard pressed to find success. Likewise in the reverse, expect to be the squad\'s favorite person if you pick up a much needed role like support, which drops supplies needed for garrisons, or engineer which repairs vehicles and builds fortifications. Or, if you\'re a more casual player (like me) just snag rifleman or medic, toss out ammo or heals like it\'s going out of style and you\'ll do just fine.The game is very easy to pick up and play if you have a decent rig, but it will take a long time to master. The high skill players can pick out the slightly darker gray pixel of a German helmet in a window from 200m away with ease, or can accurately predict your movement behind a hedgerow and that\'s if the sheer volume of fire doesn\'t get you first. Hell Let Loose, in my opinion, is not a game you play for a competitive environment. It\'s a game you play for the sheer scale and immersion, which is only amplified when you begin to play with friends and/or in an organized squad. Nothing is quite as fun as pulling out a clutch back cap of a point, or participating in some intense last stand at the final few minutes of a match. If you want large-scale, slower paced and immersive game then definitely pick this one up on the next steam sale.',''),(858,'I bought the game.

The game\'s introduction stages are easy to follow and actually teach you about the overall interface and controls, necessary for successfully running any zoo. You gain ultimate control over all in game items including a global rotate and advanced movement tools, allowing for extremely detailed customization; the workshop comes in handy here as players can share blueprint (pre-made) builds/buildings through Steam.The only real con to this game is the insane amount of DLCs, however this is curbed by them being decently cheap and made even cheaper by passing Steam sales.

It\'s more of a map creator with animals than anything. If you aren\'t a super patient, talented, and creative person with LOTS of time to spare, Planet Zoo truly is unbearable. when I first bought the game I thought that it was a fun & simple game with beautiful graphics where I could build a giant zoo and fill it with animals to my hearts delight. Instead I got a complicated and intricate piece-by-piece building system with subpar graphics. Gameplay is unfun and exhausting where just building a simple exhibit is almost impossible for the average Joe. The only that is actually somewhat enjoyable is placing the animals. Even if you finally build a zoo you\'re satisfied with after building it\'s completely useless. You are not the zookeeper you can not interact with the animals after you build the zoo. The animals are lifeless they just meander aimlessly around their accommodations. The baby animals are not born realistically even though age rating would make it acceptable they don\'t even nurse. The guests are whiny and are never satisfied. So, Frontier please bring Zoo Tycoon back to life.',''),(866,'Very complicated.

It\'s awesome!I didn\'t even bother to play career, just a few missions as tutorial, and then I went to franchise where one can buy and sell animals from an online players\' market. With all the DLCs now you can breed your favorite animals and make a profit too.Step by step you can learn to build very nice and elaborate things, for example a temple shelter in your African savanna or a viewing gallery that has that shelter on the other part of a glass wall. The landscaping part is also easy to understand and very well done, so you can make all kind of land and water features, like waterfalls and caves in the mountains.Planet Zoo it\'s by far the best game for you if you want to play with animals and build a park exactly as you like it. You even get to build, if you want, a huge savanna, with many, many animals in it, without fear that the peeps will complain that they don\'t see anything in it, because you can make suspended paths or gondolas or even a subterranean passage that has a viewing bubble in the middle of your habitat. You can even build barriers and habitats with moats and just an invisible barrier.This is by far the best feeling-good game that I have played in the last ten years.Pros:- you get to see cute animals who do cute things- you can build whatever you like, not only buildings, but landscapes too- the graphics are fantastic- the community is very active in the online market and in the workshop- the game has Steam workshop which is easy to use, not like many new games that don\'t offer support for this anymore- it\'s very gratifying to sell and find animals on the online market and also to see the new pupsCons:- a lot of micromanagement for big parks: you shouldn\'t inbreed the animals, so when they mature you must sell them, move them in storage or release them in the wild and when you have a big park you must do that every several seconds; also because of this it\'s a nightmare to breed for example penguins if you don\'t like to manage hundreds of them.',''),(869,'As of December this game is broken , you cannot connect to their Servers and it will kick you every 5 Minutes, they are aware of it and have no solution as yet, I am referring to the email they sent to me',''),(870,'goofy ahhh cumjar type FPS due to game engine.',''),(871,'accidentally combine the lion enclosure with the zebras',''),(872,'it be good',''),(873,'best game i love it (:',''),(874,'lmao i love abusing visitora',''),(875,'I love it.

As if this game is in any way an E-Sport. If my living was wasted based on sitting down all day playing this game I would be really good at it too.

Story is short, about 15 hours, and a little easy. However, you can play it multiple times taking different sides. There is also endless mode, and more content coming.A few thoughts to the developers:First, shootouts are too easy. I feel I can stand there and never die, just pop headshot by headshot. The big red markers make these interactions point-and-click without any strategy, and they also break the immersion of no HUD. First time, I was out of ammo, but manged to knife 4 guys without too much resistance, and I think that shouldn\'t be possible. Being attacked on the road is just a nuisance, not a challenge. Especially late-game with good rifles and health, I can just stand in the middle of the road and click below the red markers, and that\'s it.Second, there\'s too much driving back and forth. Granted, I normally drove my contraband and prisoners whenever there were 2+, not realizing I might as well wait for more, but it still seems excessive. Being able to deliver prisoners and contraband at both locations could alleviate this.Third, spotting smugglers is a little too easy. They always leave that UV mark, and if there is a hint like partial registration number, once you see it it\'s almost always going to be a smuggler. Also, it feels unlikely that the authorities know something about every single smuggler. How about adding some extra smugglers, which don\'t give you penalty if not found, but a significant boost if found? Like an unknown smuggler.Finally, I would like more stuff to spend money on. The later half of the game I was hovering 10.000-15.000, but the upgrades didn\'t feel too meaningful.

Ambushes are bugged because enemies glitch through the map and are nowhere to be seen. This is more of a severe annoyance due to constantly being hounded by the combat music everywhere I go. Because there is an active ambush that is impossible to end, I\'m unable to see any other objectives or move on to do anything else in peace.  Also, I\'m unable to melee attackers because my character gets into some kind of bugged state where my melee weapon never reaches the enemy despite the weapon being in their faces. (I\'ve had this happen with the knife and the pitchfork already and I\'m positive it\'ll happen with any other melee weapon.) I\'m unable to switch weapons. I\'m unable to interact with vehicles and the only way to deal with this is to alt+f4 and start the day over because reloading checkpoints is broken due to the infinite loading screen bug. This is just a few of many game-breaking and severe issues this game has and it\'s mind-boggling how the devs never bothered fixing these problems and it\'s even more egregious how this game has so many positive reviews with so many game-breaking bugs. Apparently, people think games that are barely functional are masterpieces. I\'m more convinced that content creators blow this game up so much and give the wrong impressions. Is the game good? No. I can\'t get through the first day because, I keep encountering countless game-breaking bugs one after another with no end in sight. Can it be good? Yes, if the devs actually get off their rear-ends and fix their game instead of riding the high of \"success\" and exposure it\'s been getting lately like every other studio that gets a spot of exposure and cares more about that than their own game does. I don\'t care what others say. The game is broken beyond belief and it\'s a miracle it even functions. These issues should have been dealt with a very long time ago.',''),(927,'The concept of this game is great. The execution is not so great. There are a lot of little annoying bugs that really add up and make the game not enjoyable. I\'ve had to restart the day in campaign mode multiple times because of bugs or weird failures (i.e. find 3 things wrong with a vehicle and send it back, get penalized because the game thought they were fine). Either I can\'t add or it\'s really > 3 rather than >= 3. Unable to sleep some times because the game thinks I need to clear a vehicle that doesn\'t exist. Dead raiders that don\'t count for the total. The only way to fix it is to reload but the reload takes more than 5 mins.

It looked promising from the trailer and turns out the more I played the more interested I was as I progressed more through the game.The pros:- A theme that stands out, the world around you is mostly ordinary but it presents a good survival situation from your playable characters being very tiny. The world is vast with different biomes and an immersive atmosphere.- Easy to get into and understand, lots to learn as you play more. You got your health, stamina and hunger bars to manage as in many survival games and the rest is up to you to discover.- The freedom, as soon as you\'re out of the starting tutorial area you can do as you please and go mostly wherever you want. There are quests but the game doesn\'t hold your hand or force you to a specific route, the world is yours to explore as you want.- The combat is very satisfying, and I was pleasantly surprised by how developed it is. You can dodge, block, parry at the right moment to stun your enemies and there are different types of damage and weapons too. It adds a lot of variety to how you want to approach every combat situation.- You can customize your game exactly how you want, make it harder or easier, change the length of the season cycle as well as set the aggression of the creatures around you. There is something for everyone, be it a casual experience or a challenging word to survive in.- The building aspect, if you like making a good looking camp/base the game offers you a variety of different materials and decorations to choose from, but if not you can still keep it basic and its perfectly viable.The cons:- The bosses and minibosses, I was hesitant to approach them on my first playthrough, but when I actually got around to fighting them I was disappointed. Most of them have one or two different attacks which isn\'t what I expected given how strong the combat with ordinary enemies started out. There are also creatures that I thought would just one shot you or you would need a special item to be able to beat them but that is not the case, you can just go in and defeat them if you have the health and potions to spare and you know how to block.- Mount imbalance, there are several creatures you can tame to ride and they help with travel and/or combat. But in the early to mid game I see no reason not to use the grasshopper over the others just because it has so much mobility and allows you to traverse the map very easily. It is a shame because it lessens the otherwise solid variety the game offers you.- A lack of greater reward for greater challenge: The amount of resources you obtain from fighting is the exact same on the easiest and hardest difficulties. It would be great if there were more drops or perhaps even unique drops to incentivize players who have conquered the wilderness already and want something more to go with a greater challenge.Conclusion:Given the price and what you get for it I definitely recommend the game. I give it a solid 8/10, it has a lot of good and a few bad things about it but overall its worthwhile if you\'re looking for a new survival game. As of writing this review the game is still in early access so a lot can change with time. And this is all my opinion so feel free to agree or disagree, thanks for reading my review!',''),(939,'Valheim with bugs',''),(940,'Smalland is an absolutely delightful and enchanting game that transports players into a whimsical and captivating world like no other. From the moment I entered this pint-sized paradise, I was immediately captivated by the rich, immersive environment that teems with vibrant life and unexpected adventures.One of the standout features of Smalland is its stunning graphics. Every blade of grass, fluttering butterfly, and towering tree is beautifully rendered, creating an atmosphere that feels alive and brimming with possibilities. The attention to detail is truly remarkable, making it easy to lose oneself in this enchanting miniature universe.But it isn\'t just the visuals that make Smalland an exceptional game. The gameplay mechanics are incredibly unique and innovative, allowing players to experience the world from a new and refreshing perspective. As a tiny being, I found myself constantly amazed at the challenges and obstacles I had to overcome—whether it was crafting tools to build a shelter or finding creative ways to outwit the critters that roamed this tiny realm.What further sets Smalland apart is its seamless integration of survival and exploration elements. With limited resources and constant danger lurking around every corner, the game never fails to keep players on their toes while embarking on thrilling quests and uncovering the hidden secrets of this whimsical world. The sense of accomplishment one feels when successfully completing a daring mission is truly exhilarating.Moreover, Smalland offers a remarkable multiplayer experience. Coordinating and working together with friends to overcome obstacles and achieve shared goals adds an extra layer of excitement and camaraderie to the gameplay. There is nothing quite like collaborating with fellow tiny adventurers to build a thriving community in this wondrous realm.Finally, the sound design and soundtrack of Smalland deserve special mention. The melodic tunes perfectly match the game\'s atmosphere, evoking a sense of childlike wonder and exploration. The subtle ambient sounds, whether it\'s the chirping of birds or the rustling of leaves, further enhance the immersive experience and make it feel like you are truly part of this miniature world.In conclusion, Smalland is an exceptional game that combines stunning visuals, innovative gameplay mechanics, and a captivating world to create an unforgettable gaming experience. Whether you are a seasoned gamer or new to the gaming world, this masterpiece offers something for everyone. Immerse yourself in the whimsy and adventure of Smalland, and prepare to be enchanted',''),(941,'I do enjoy the game, but it is not ready. Been playing with a friend, and all of our structure got completely wiped, game stability is not great, get kicked frequently and game AI struggles.

Yes, it is flagged as early access, but the current content is rather a snapshot instead of a well rounded, enjoyable experience. While my friend and I grinded some components at the start, around mid to late game it became completely obsolete to farm for anything else. We also skipped many sets of gear because they were not necessary to obtain. We also increased the difficulty to \"difficult\" with increased mob damage and HP. The game still was rather easy to play with no rewards for increased difficulty. We can also agree on the mounts being incredibly unbalanced with no adapted stats to their, in reality, unique traits. The damselfly was not a single bit faster than the Hornet while being much squishier and no abilities to attack. The grasshopper was literally the fastest and earliest mount to obtain in the game, maybe apart from the incredibly expensive blue tit mount at the very end of the game. Where\'s the reward in grinding for that if the game is basically over once you are able to obtain the blue tit?Leveling the pets was also rather useless. In the area in the north, we immediately encountered a hornet lvl 98. So why make the effort and level the low level hornets from the southern area? Mobs usually ranged from level 4-16 there.At its current state, the northern area is unfinished and doesn\'t connect well with the southern area. we also didn\'t find the missions to be in any way engaging. So in conclusion, the game is mediocre at best and compared to other \"small world\" games on steam, this one feels unpolished and repetitive quickly.',''),(944,'Clean graphics, the movement feels nice, the combat is solid, gathering is plentiful, weather and season changes and effects are done well, base construction is satisfying, lots of options to make it as cozy or survivor as you want it to be, the ability to move your base into other worlds, feels good solo or co-op, overall pretty well polished. If this sounds like fun to you I 10/10 would recommend.',''),(945,'Recommended players: at least one friend, unless you\'re built different and enjoy soloing these games.Fun adventure/survival game similar to Grounded, but more fantasy instead of sci-fi. You\'re a sort of Borrower-esque forest elf with slight bug features, whose civilization lives underground. As a explorer/warrior in your culture, your job is to explore the surface world after humans have disappeared and find a cure for your queen\'s illness. Because of your size, everything from an ant to an eagle is a threat, so you must take up arms and cut your way through the wilderness on the surface.+ Melee and ranged combat, harvesting resources with different tools, and building bases to house all your klepto goods are the main ways you interact with the game. Feels great to get your ♥♥♥♥ pushed in by a bull ant, only to get better at fighting and parrying them, and then finally being stronger with more advanced gear and nearly one-shotting them as you go about your day. + Day and night cycle actually serves some purpose too, with different mobs spawning at night. Haven\'t noticed them giving different drops, just seems more hostile outside at night time. And the changing of the seasons in-game is real cool too, seeing an area you\'re familiar with looking totally different covered in a blanket of snow.- I just wish the dragonfly I tamed didn\'t die literally right away, kinda turned me off from wanting to tame any other bugs to use them as mounts.',''),(946,'100% recommend, in my top 5 favorite games. love the visuals, combat, audio and the game play is great. can\'t wait for some of the bugs from early access to be fixed, but great game and have already suggested to anyone that will listen.

Your shelters must be constructed with adequate support and ventilation of smoke in mind, and interior comforts increase the amount of rest you gain, incentivizing you to not just build a house, but a nice house.You can construct paired portals to fast travel across the map, but certain raw materials cannot be carried through them, which creates interesting logistical choices between shipping materials over long distances by cart or by boat, and building outposts to process and craft your materials closer to where they are mined.  Additionally, certain crops can only grow in certain biomes, which further incentivizes setting up multiple bases.  Thankfully, the rewarding nature of the building system makes the prospect of building a new base an opportunity rather than a burden.Like most games in this genre, a good amount of time is spent gathering resources, but the amount you need never seems onerous.  It can be time consuming, but this is often because you will get interrupted by monsters drawn to the sound of mining ore and chopping trees, which breaks up what could otherwise be a monotonous task.And lastly, the game\'s unique graphical style is gorgeous.  Low polygon counts and simple textures free up resources that are spent on beautiful lighting, atmospherics, and color composition.This type of open-world survival/building game isn\'t for everyone.  It\'s heavy on atmosphere, but light on story, and there are some routine repetitive tasks involved.  But if you\'ve ever enjoyed another game in this genre, or are curious and looking for one to start on, Valheim strikes an amazing balance that accentuates the genre\'s strengths while minimizing its inherent flaws.',''),(999,'Need more Wood',''),(1000,'My biggest advice is don\'t spoil whats in the game by looking up everything in each biome. Try to keep as many things as you can a mystery. Once you loose that sense of adventure it wont be as fun. Other than that, this game is incredible.

I played it with my wife, but she didn´t like it.I played it with my friends, but they didn´t like it. I played solo, I tried mods, I looked up guides. I gave it chance after chance, because usually I like this type of game and most people online seem to love it but I just can´t get into it. I do love the atmosphere, but that´s about it. My biggest problems with it are the clunky combat system and the grind. I have also felt like hitting a wall after killing the first boss in several of my saves.In my latest attempt I spent hours exploring burial chambers, looking for surtling cores. I died at least a dozen times, killed five times that many skeletons and ended up with a grand total of one core. I´ve made it past the bronze stage before, but everything I did after that felt like even more of a chore to me, except for building my base.

It is possible (I\'ve cleared 2 maps starting each with new characters because of patches), but not much fun after awhile and too frustrating.  There is a HUGE difficulty increase when you get to swamp.  I find Bonemass on this new map since new patch I\'m playing and all mobs from swamp are spawned and most are 2 stars.  Tired of having to use arrows and can\'t survive melee at all even with maxed out iron gear.  You have to kill Bonemass and once you clear Mountain and get silver gear, then can you have decent melee in the swamp.  Swamp should be the last boss, place sucks.  And tired of eating every 5 minutes in this game.  I like hard gameplay, but this is annoying hard.  I guess if you\'re playing with a group it would be fun, but not everyone has a group of friends like that.',''),(1006,'I play this with friends and I got to say on a positive note the atmosphere is nice and building is fun, but the game is painfully slow something alot of people seem to agree on. Grinding through the stone age takes a bit of time, trying to get through the bronze age though is like watching paint dry, I don\'t mind running back to the black forest to get materials but upkeeping coal for smelting is a hassle because it depletes very quickly and the payoff for getting copper is not much. The food system is cool at first but overall redundant and tedious once you realize you\'ll be dealing with it for the rest of the game, your base health is 25, you\'d figure that defeating a boss would raise your hp but it doesn\'t.Secondly is dock building, trying to build a dock that reaches out into the water is a ridiculous time consuming process that takes for ever to accomplish because you can\'t build while swimming so you have to wait for a storm to take the tide back multiple times, run out go build, wait for it to lower, repeat, then your dock requires daily maintenance because the wood takes water damage. Why the need for a dock? because in the case your ship is to close to shore during a storm it will get slammed and beaten to where I have had to build 3 ships again because of this.lastly would be the community, It\'s not what I would call toxic but there\'s this weird overly protective passive aggressive attitude towards anyone suggesting helpful changes, and it becomes a real turn off. Example: Gee dock building is really difficult I think they should implement a system to where it would be easier to accomplish.Responses usually go something like this: Ever tried building a dock irl because that\'s pretty hard.Example 2: Hey I think that when some defeats the first boss they should get a health and stamina increase, that way we aren\'t relying on food forever and food instead gives us passive buffs.Response: Ever tried surviving without food irl because that\'s pretty hard.I\'ve never fought an undead skeleton irl but I\'d imagine that would be pretty hard, I\'ve never fought a troll irl but I\'d imagine that would be pretty hard.There are people suggesting really helpful, creative, and detailed ideas that could definitely help the game, then there are those so reluctant to change and I don\'t see the validity as to why that is when presented.Overall the game is only fun at first but after awhile you feel like progression becomes more punishing than it does become rewarding and at certain points feels like it hits stagnation for long periods.

The upgrades are very fluid, you cannot ever know exactly how much that you have of people/products because they will come and go, which just makes it hard to manage things. Trade routes are weird and setting up trades with npcs is. The way the fog of war clears is jarring and paired with the way you move around the map from location to location as creator makes it hard to see everything. The menus aren\'t great. They really need an economy tab where I can view all my locations for a particular product.  The biggest thing though, is that I will just randomly be defeated? and the game will take me back to the title screen for seemingly no reason. There is virtually no indications that this kind of thing is happening. I didn\'t get all my shares bought up. I had a bunch of stuff going on. I had trade routes and had completed all my missions that had timers except the one I just picked up, and from what I could tell I was doing great, but I\'d get defeated. And it doesn\'t even tell you why you got defeated, just that you are... blank screen with a button that takes you to the title? Like wtf? And npcs will just randomly decide they do or don\'t like you anymore? There needs to be a way to control this more. Also, other leaders don\'t like my propaganda....its propaganda, why do they even know I\'m using it? Doesn\'t that defeat the whole purpose of propaganda? Just needs to be majorly cleaned up. For the way you move around the board and how many different places your fleet can be it is absolutely LUDICROUS to me that there is no proper pause. You can \'slow down\' but its really not enough for proper planning, especially when you can potentially buy up the whole map, but you can\'t ever pause anything to get a full scope of what you are doing?

Why is there barely any building? What happened to those fantastic original levels? Why would they switch to overhead perspective? Why does mumble mode suck? Free Roam is absolutely attrocious! Almost no puzzle solving, big empty areas with nothing to do',''),(1044,'I will say right off the bat, this is not a difficult game. This is not hard or meant to be too challenging. If you are looking for something with more difficulty, the older LEGO games will be for you.However, that being said.. this is the largest LEGO Star Wars game to date! The sheer amount of characters, missions and content to interact with, do and collect is staggering. Compared to previous games which had individual selections with their own missions, condensing each trilogy down to a series of 6-8 missions for each movie. This game has every single Star Wars movie/trilogy so far, and even characters from things like TV series\' or extra content if you go for the character DLC. (Yes, even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Disney sequels.)There are over 200 characters to collect in the base game, many missions to do, and places to explore. Every planet in the game is a large free-roam map with multiple places to go, things to explore and people to talk to. They even have player and class upgrades and various boosts to buy with things you find! That being said, if you aren\'t too keen on doing side missions and the story content is what you\'re after, this game probably has the shortest story segments of any previous LEGO Star Wars game. Previously each trilogy had many individual missions based off of each movie, here, each \"era\"/movie of Star Wars has only 5 individual missions for each. All with varying lengths in what you are actually supposed to do. For example, The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge of the Sith all together are only 15 missions long. If you are looking for a LEGO game with lengthy story content similar to the Complete Saga, and want to spend a good long while on lengthy missions enjoying the variety, this game may not be for you. The missions aren\'t exactly long compared to The Complete Saga, but they aren\'t so short they\'re breezed through in a few minutes either, there\'s just less of them.However, if you want a LOT of stuff to do in a LEGO game, and the story bits don\'t concern you much, like Freeplay, then you will likely really love this. There are so many characters, new classes, different abilities, and new \"perks\" with different types of characters that.. it\'s honestly staggering. Not only that but the open world areas have so many hidden areas, collectibles and easter eggs that it\'s honestly great to roam around in! Hell, they even made characters never before seen playable as playable characters in this, such as pod racers like Sebulba, characters have multiple outfits like Jar Jar\'s senator outfit, and everyone has all updated appearances compared to the older models used in Classic LEGO! Not to mention the voice acting.TLDR: If your here for the story and mission/level design, you may want to skip this one as it has less individual missions and less mission length then the past LEGO Star Wars games. But if you want a game with a massive sandbox to play as whomever you want from a massive cast of characters, you\'ll like this! The sheer amount of characters they\'ve shoved into this game is.. staggering.',''),(1045,'Great sequel to the original saga',''),(1046,'digital crack',''),(1047,'I bought this game with the excitement from the nostalgia of old lego games like: lord of the rings, harry-potter, pirates of the Caribbean, lego marvel super heros, batman and many more. But this game was just outright disappointing. I don\'t know if it\'s because I\'m older or if the game is to blame, but i didn\'t get the same joy i remember getting back then. The game itself has changed a lot from the old lego game recipe. skill trees have been added and the combat slightly more complicated than the old lego beat-em up formula.',''),(1048,'Ambitious but annoying. I had to force myself through the game a lot. That’s because up to 90% of it is just mindless filler. I remember being genuinely amazed by the open world concept back when playing Lego Marvel Avengers for the first time. Had I known that it would eventually devolve into something like this, I certainly would have been more skeptical. Let’s start with the first few things that bothered me. The Hud is very crammed with unnecessary displays. And those that are necessary don’t need to be this big. Some could thankfully be turned off. In addition to this, the camera, unlike previous Lego games, is too zoomed in on the character, amplifying your lack of vision. Then we have a similar issue with markers. Whether it’s collectibles or enemies in spaceship battles, the hud is just clustered to ♥♥♥♥ with these markers. I can hardly find anything when looking for one specific objective. But it doesn’t stop there, these spaceship battles are a massive pain in the ass. Partially due to the controls simply refusing to operate when moving too much into a certain direction, but mostly because they are too frequent and time-consuming. Every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ delivery mission will have you sit through 3 separate loading screens accompanied by a battle after each. A competent developer would have stuck all the battles into the same area.And speaking of loading screens, that’s what you will be seeing the most throughout the game. Why? Because 90% of it is filler content. Whether it’s collectibles or quests in the open world, that’s where you will be spending the majority of the game. We are talking about 24 planets, each with upwards of 30 collectibles and various quests. The worst part is that a lot of these quests will send you on a journey throughout the galaxy. This is one of the worst cases of fetch quests syndrome I’ve ever seen. Imagine sitting through 5 or more loading screen for each quest. But that’s not all, because the developers decided to be very generous with the world size. There is a ton of walking in this game. If you want to torture yourself with this garbage game, go to Hoth and do the Wampa quest to unlock the character, he is the fastest to my knowledge.Then we have the absolute biggest pisstake of this entire game. It’s the character selection. Unlike previous games, there isn’t a button that will automatically swap to the next characters in your roster. Every time you want to change your character, you will be forced to open your roster manually and select the character your want. And because the buttons for browsing through your roster can’t be edited, you will always be forced to take your right hand off the mouse to hit your arrow keys for that. But it gets worse. Because in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, your roster doesn’t give you all the characters you need. You will have to open the character menu, which is the most convoluted pile of ♥♥♥♥ I have ever experienced in any game, select the character, close the menu completely, open your roster again, then pick the character you just put into your roster. I really want to know what kind of mindless baboon came up with such a nonsensical system.The only positive thing I can say for this game is how short the levels are. Unfortunately they managed to ruin those too. They introduced a new form of lightsaber combat which stretches every boss fight unnecessarily long. Remember how boss fights took a mere minute to finish in the original Lego Star Wars? Well, prepare for 5-10 minutes of fighting, running around, doing a bunch of ♥♥♥♥, just to finish each level that has a boss fight. Lego games never needed a complex combat system, it’s just too much for what these games are trying to be. Button mashing and quick time events? ♥♥♥♥ right off. I just want to finish the fight already. And to add insult to injury, they decided to add challenges for every mission which are mandatory for 100% completion. Thanks for making every level even more convoluted. Because now I have to look up a guide to make absolutely sure to accomplish this very precise task.I think I’m done with Lego games as a whole if this is the route they want to take. It took me 67 hours to finish this awfully coded mess. I didn’t even mention a few other things. Like how you can sometimes softlock a level because the scripted lightsaber combat won’t happen, the amount of unnecessary character categories, the lack of abilities that were present in previous games like grabbing enemies with force lightning and hovering generous distances as certain characters, how your second computer player is literally braindead most of the times and can’t do basic tasks that were no problem in previous installments, unskippable cutscenes, and many more that I couldn’t be bothered to memorize. All you need to know is this, there are 1200 collectibles, most of which are acquired through patted-out filler content. 90% of my time was spent fast traveling from planet to planet, just to gather collectibles or finish quests. Only positive thing I can say in this regard is how the developers didn’t account for players using the force on their partner to easily cheese certain collectibles. Thanks for that. I would also like to thank both J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson for ruining a multibillion-dollar franchise.

There are minor inconveniences that really add up to a full on disdain for the game. There\'s no window of recuperation after an incap revival.

A pinned survivor literally does a 🧍‍♂️, and a pounced survivor freed goes straight from \"on the ground\" to \"🧍‍♂️\" in less than 0.5 seconds. It also is very frustrating that there is no reactive counterplay available to these other than strafing and getting lucky.

This game, however, is not that. It\'s complex and confusing for seemingly no reason. My biggest problem is the \"Act\" select. It\'s not like in L4D where you just pick a map, pick a difficulty, and play. This time, you need to \"Create a New Run\", then something happens I dunno It\'s CONFUSING (Genuinely not sure if you can pick different maps/campaigns), pick a difficulty, pick a character, choose some cards, then some other things pop up or something, and THEN you can play. Then you realize that you already played through the map it selected, then you leave andd... Well, it\'s stupid. It REALLY should be how it was in L4D. It was simple and strait-forward. Despite the confusing and complex nature of this game, I would give it a 8.5/10. (SIDE-NOTE: I would REALLY recommend getting this game when it\'s on sale, instead of buying it normally. I got the Ultimate edition which is almost $100 for LESS than the price of the normal game, which is $50. I don\'t remember what sale that was... Probably Christmas.

Strap in, and grab a cup of hot chocolate, daddy\'s gonna tell stories again:If I compare my experience playing the first game on release to this one on release, this one is much, much better. But how?The original Cities: Skylines was a relief from the crushed dreams of SimCity fans. It came in as the rightful conqueror of the city building genre, and built a huge community of gamers, designers and modders that have influenced the growth of the game since. It refined the SimCity style beyond expectations, it broke the gridded city building style, it introduced gamers to urban design and planning ideas that they have never thought of before, and a whole sub-genre of urbanist YouTubers rose up from this. However, when you compare the two vanilla games, without the mods and DLC and hundred of YouTube content creators, the first game is great, but a bit empty. It didn\'t start with a day-night cycle, that was added in After Dark. It didn\'t start with many of the best transit options, they came in later DLCs. Inland water treatment plants didn\'t exist until 2020 with Sunset Harbor.Cities: Skylines 2 starts with everything that the base game should have. It doesn\'t only have a day-night cycle, it has seasons. It doesn\'t just have different zoning densities, it has mixed use zones. You don\'t just place down industry building and print money, the game has a diversified economy, hearkening back to SimCity2000 when you could individually manage tax rates for different industries, but here you can do that to the entire economy. You can encourage and develop an economy based on retail and services, or primary industries, or manufacturing of any kind. You don\'t just have buses, trains and planes, you have the option to use taxis, buses, trains, trams, subway metros, planes and boats to transport your people and cargo outside cars and trucks. To build the city you don\'t just lay down roads, you can plan curves and bends and intersections using the various feedback that it gives you, create clean interchanges and intersections, and use a variety of tools to limit turns and eliminate traffic conflicts. You can even obverse traffic accidents affect your roads and disasters affect the city, pollution affecting the environment and a myriad other things that you didn\'t even think of when the original was released in 2015.Compared to that, yeah, no questions.So why is everyone saying \"Yes, but ...\"?I won\'t repeat it in detail, you\'ve already read the other reviews. Basically, expectations for the game\'s performance and delivery were misaligned between the developers, the publishers and the consumers. Performance issues were a huge problem right off the bat because most people do not have systems that meet the requirements of the game, but the developers have been tasked with making the game suitable for console. Misaligned expectations. The game\'s economic system was too opaque to clearly understand what was going on, to the point that unsubstantiated rumours began spreading that the economy was fake (it\'s not). Feedback to the user was not adequate to completely understand what was going on, and many players assumed things were bugs when they were not. Misaligned expectations.However, the performance issues and opaque UI feedback aside, none of this was helped by the myriad of bugs that have since seen six major patches to clean up, with more work to come out after the Christmas holidays.Finally, to nail the point home about misaligned expectations: content. I came in to the original game in March 2015, right on release. I was with it the whole way through. I was there when the beacons were lit and Gondor called for aid. I didn\'t even bother using mods until 2019, because that\'s when they were interesting and mature enough to really make a difference in the game. By the time the Great Plague of 2020 hit, the original was primed to receive huge interest in the game. Content on the workshop exploded. YouTubers exploded. Everything exploded. It was wild! So when, in early 2023, the new game was announced, a host of gamers came in with huge content expectations and none of the context. YouTubers speculated on the most insane speculations, people were having meltdowns about the new engine staying on Unity instead of hopping over to Unreal Engine. Wild.And so on release, despite having literally been released with more tools and content than city builders have ever had, with all of the good ideas from everywhere in the broader community being incorporated into the base game, the chief criticism was a lack of content. The game felt empty. Grey (UK)! Gray (US)! Graey (WTF)! Critiques went from blasting CS1 for being too cartoony to blasting CS2 for being too realistic with its browns and concretes. At this point, I stopped listening to shameless and pointless, often contradictory criticism and looked for genuine concerns.These are easy to list:- the game is still in need of more performance fixes- the game\'s UI needs more obvious indicators of what\'s going on with underlying systems- the game is a resource H-O-G- tools still feel a bit unrefined- there are missing options that would make things so much nicer (props, prop tools, decorative tools, etc)- no mods at the moment, we want mods- no editors, no map editor, no asset editor, none of that yet- console version still needs to be released- the bug issues have delayed the Ultimate Edition\'s Q4 and Q1 DLC releases- there are still some major bugs that require further investigationTo be frank, though, my stance is straightforward: bugs can be fixed, and these issues will be ironed out over time. The devs have repeatedly shown that they intend to see this through.So yes, \"I recommend, but ...\", be mindful of the things that are still to be fixed, and you may enjoy the game. \"I don\'t recommend, however ...\", set your expectations appropriately and you will realise this game has enormous potential to be the definitive game of the city simulation genre. The first game rightfully conquered the crown. This one will keep it, even it has to fight for it.',''),(1079,'It\'s not ready yet. Let it cook.',''),(1080,'The potential is there but this game is in beta at best. I put hundreds of hours into the original CS and this game is awful in comparison. I didn\'t pay to test the game for you.',''),(1081,'The novelty of the experience has dissipated, and the enjoyment in engaging with this game has waned. I have acquired a comprehensive understanding of the simulation, if one could generously term it as such. Frankly, this game appears to be a substantial misrepresentation, even in light of recent updates. Upon reviewing the weekly developer videos, one is left to ponder whether they were addressing an entirely different game. It strains credulity that any of the developers have successfully managed a city exceeding 100k in population. Below, I enumerate a series of grievances:Cargo possesses the ability to teleport indiscriminately from one location to another, obviating the necessity for any form of vehicular transport.Absence of toggleable zoning on roads, a manifestation I classify as a bug.The Statistics Panel/Menu displays only half of the chart.Canines are inexplicably abandoned when a simulated entity utilizes public transportation to a destination beyond the city limits.Frequent crashes to the desktop occurring approximately every three hours.Influxes of taxis originating from external locales, converging on an arbitrary point, idling, and subsequently departing the city via ostensibly the most inconvenient route, characterized by its protracted duration or sluggish pace.Occasional inexplicable surges in the \"waiting on a hearse\" phenomenon without corresponding spikes in statistical data.Inoperative post and mail sorting systems.Hospitals and clinics perennially devoid of medical supplies, resulting in diminished efficiency.Inexplicable preference for exporting over support for local businesses.Persistent pollution of water bodies, unaffected by the passage of a decade despite strong water flow.Shifts in wind direction, notably the Barrier island experiencing inland winds, leading to the dispersal of pollution over the city.Discordance between Chirps (in-game messages) and actual occurrences within the city.The need to mute the radio after 25 minutes due to its repetitive nature, devoid of relevance to the city\'s development.Paradoxically, the game operates at its maximum efficiency on the 1x speed setting, while higher settings result in slowdowns rather than acceleration (i.e., 0.5 or 0.2).The inability to sustain a 15-minute simulation run before encountering graphic glitches, specifically LOD (Level of Detail) flickering.A discordant and unappealing city soundscape, rendering the developer\'s claims about audio in the trailer incongruous.Public transport lines sporadically reverting to the default color.The flatten terrain tool fails to render the land truly flat, leaving undulating hills and bumps in its wake.An anomalous phenomenon of \"building on water\" in the absence of proximate water sources.Issues abound in both vehicular traffic and pedestrian behavior, surpassing the deficiencies observed in the first iteration of the game.Vehicles mysteriously despawn while moving at full speed.Ongoing utilization of a removed pedestrian crossing by simulated individuals.Peculiar stop-start behavior in the traffic AI\'s interaction with roundabouts at full speed.Last-minute lane changes by the traffic AI, involving abrupt stops and 90-degree turns.Proliferation of illegal U-turns throughout the city, inducing frustration.',''),(1082,'Check what the CEO of CO just posted:Thanks for all the feedback. When it comes to the gameplay and simulation we set goals for the game and we have reached those goals.Surely there are issues that we\'re looking into and fixing bugs, but the overall gameplay experience is what we aimed for. Cities: Skylines II is the better game compared to the first one. If you dislike the simulation, this game just might not be for you. If there is a bug that ruins it for you there\'s a good chance it\'s fixed sometime in the future. Games are a subjective experience and it is impossible to please everyone. There\'s a bugfixing patch on its way soon however, so hopefully we\'ll be able to resolve at least some of the issues that may be a deal breaker for some. We thank you for your patience!For clarity the above is for the simulation and gameplay. The performance is not where we want it to be and we are hard at work to improve it. This is also the reason the consoles were delayed.

Here\'s a few reasons this game sucks so much:1. The simulation (kinda important) won\'t create demand for anything but low-density housing. You have to find ways to trick it into getting a real city.2. Bugs everywhere. One tax bug bankrupted me before giving me millions, totally randomly. Had to turn the tax rate to 0% to stabilize it after exploiting it to generate some money. Might as well just play with unlimited money since the economy is completely broken.3. Game decides what streets are connected and you can\'t change it. Have a roundabout leading into another road? Well too bad, you can\'t rename it without renaming both roads because the game gods decided it\'s just one continuous segment.4. Performance issues, but this is a known issue. It actually ran ok on my system (got to ~50k pop).5. Graphics are oddly gray all the time.6. Glaring lack of basic features: no university campus, no complex parks, no commercial or office specializations, no dirt roads, only one type of pedestrian path, no quays/canals/any water landscaping, and so much more.Basically, this is an unfinished, buggy demo - and even if they fixed the obvious issues it\'s still worse than the original game.

Cities Skylines 1 fans will be disappointed. Some concepts were simplified (almost childish) and some made really complex for no reason.Set a calendar reminder 1 year from now to come back and maybe buy the game. It might be stable by then.Alright, here are the bullet points detailing the issues I came across a bit more.Reasons not to buy (game philosophy):- Portions of the simulation are... simulated... (that was the whole selling point of CS!)Really hope that this is another \"bug\" that will be hotfixed and not core to the game design. It has Sim City Societies vibes right now.Confirmed by the CEO of the company that this is intended: \"If you dislike the simulation, this game just might not be for you.\"- Progression goes through \"XP\" (build a tonne of buildings with 0 pop and progress...)Feels very childish. You don\'t feel that sense of accomplishment for the city improving.- The Tech Tree does not provide you with any meaningful choices that impact your gameplay Feels very out of place in the way that it was implemented. A Tech Tree implies branches and picking a few to get different outcomes. Here, you just mash XP and then unlock everything really quickly.- Building upgrades levels are not reflected visually enough.You really don\'t get that sense that things are improving except that buildings are getting taller.- Wealth = Education level. This completely removes depth to gameplay. People\'s lives don\'t matter anymore, only if they get through certain levels of school.While I understand that we could make that assumption, are we cutting more corners here?- The RCI indicators purely indicate the demand of cims for a category even if this desire would mess up your city.While I like the idea and it sort of helps you, I had to spend quite some time searching through forums for answers on how to achieve demand for certain categories. It feels broken.- Import/Export of services lacks balance and control (happens magically, you can\'t really decide anything) Garbage just magically goes away! Exporting electricity does not recoup the cost of maintenance, making exporting electricity unnecessary. Reasons not to buy (related to \"Early Access\" state of the game):- The game is still being heavily hotfixed- Releasing hotfixes for core game mechanics that end up messing up your save gameI opened a save after a few days and I suddenly had way more income than before which reduced the overall feeling of difficulty of the game now that it was basically just sandbox mode.- The unofficial mod store users received a warning that saved games may just completely break since breaking changes will be made to how some data is handled in saved games!lol- Building upgrades are not balancedYou either have houses bumping up really fast or extremely slowly.- There is no official mod supportNo-brainer on why this is bad... A lot of bugs that the game has could\'ve been fixed by the community already.Reasons not to buy (graphics & performance):- The game is prone to crashing (make sure to enable auto-save as it is disabled by default)- Setting game settings sometimes does not save those settings (double-check that auto-save is enabled...)- (RTX 4070) the graphics end up being super ugly in order for FPS to be above 20- (RTX 4070) the framerate is way too low for the game to be enjoyable - Graphical glitches all over the place (day/night, trees blinking, buildings disappearing, etc...)- No matter how you change the graphic settings (Upscaling, Anti Aliasing, etc...), it doesn\'t feel like those really make things look better (Ugly A or Ugly B)',''),(1097,'The game\'s not ready--they\'re working on it. I wouldn\'t buy it right now...just wait to see if they fix a lot of the bugs before or shorty after the console release. If they fix it up, I\'ll happily change this review for a game I was looking forward to for years.But hey, maybe this simulation just isn\'t for me--at least that\'s what Mariina Hallikainen, CEO and co-founder of the Finnish game development studio Colossal Order has told us all.',''),(1098,'As of the Science Update, I am happy to report that I am finally enjoying this game. The framerates have vastly improved (though I havent had a chance to build anything larger than a mun rocket) and the wobbley rockets are a thing of the past. The science mode finally gives me a sense of progression in the game and the way that they blended the career mode \"quests\" with the science mode works really well in my opinion. It does a good job of guiding new players in what to do next. If you were holding off on buying this game, I actually recommend it now. Sure, it still feels like an early access game, but now the difference is there is actually a game to play instead of a vessel builder. Well done devs, and keep up the hard work.

And this cleared that hurdle.I just played about 8 hours of the game starting a new science campaign, and the campaign missions are bland but reasonably well thought out. It gives the game some structure.But jeez, none of that can keep your attention away from the just miserable amount of bugs and problems the game still has. I dont know how they keep releasing this game with just unsolveable issues everywhere you go.my favorite bug is the time advance slider. Its just so random. because it has some sort of built in delay switching between options, but you can click it a lot faster than that delay, you are just constantly in 4x speed but actually paused. Or at 1x speed but you cant use your engines because it thinks you are 2x speed still. Its not a game breaking problem, but for old kerbal veterans its just maddening because you do it ALL THE TIME. can you setup manuever nodes while paused? NOPE. gotta do it at 1x speed. But if you are in 1x speed and the game thinks you are in 2x speed, you cant interact with the node. WTF its just stupid.Want to set a target of minimus to do your alignment burn, but you have a sattelite in low earth orbit around minimus? good luck! you cant click on minimus without clicking on the satellite. Oh i will just zoom in then, nope now the satellite is like a giant pixellated icon blocking minimus entirely.I try not to judge it down just because they chose to do something differently than ksp1, but damn, try to check how much fuel you have in a random tank in your setup. You can do it, but its 3 clicks and then if you try and transfer its bugged and it keeps replicating your tank. Why on earth cant you just right click on a tank to see how much fuel is in there?they added a bunch of fancy tick marks to the map view when trying to intercept a planet, but they took away the ONE THING I NEED! the periapsis for the planet approach! its so much easier to intercept when you can minimize that periapsis value. It just makes me feel like these people have never played the original game. The ticks are nicer than the original ksp1 single tick mark i guess, but thats just to get you in the ballpark, you need that periapsis to actually intercept well.they \"fixed\" the janky rockets problem of the original, mostly by just making most of the joints rigid. Thats really how ksp1 ended up fixing it long ago. It was a little more complicated than that but fundamentally thats how it went. The one positive thing i will say, it does look like they are really trying to make it better. I had assumed when it came out that it was just a money grab. This release shows promise. Maybe with another year or two we will actually get there.',''),(1103,'I did purchase this right out of the gate and.. well.. I played for about an hour and hung it up. A lot of things that were mandatory for you to even get to orbit were broken.  I did not even have the trajectory line to maneuver off of... or see if I was going to miss the planet. I just started playing it again just over a week ago. It is fun now.... It does have a long way to go to get to the hype.. but it is early access (looking at the GIANT tag just below where I am typing for reference). The Devs seem to really be working on the feed back provided. Seeing how the game has been refined in the few months it has been in early access is great. Should YOU get it... depends.If you are willing to have an incomplete game from people that continuously worked on the previous iteration for like... a decade that will likely NEVER be a perfect game as they seem to be reaching for the stars (literally) with this game and be okay with that as it will be great fun trying to make theoretical interstellar travel as realistic as possible..

I\'ll break this down into two reviews, and will update if I run into anything that changes my mind: Newbies: If you are interested in rockets and think Kerbal might be for you, then I can confidently say that KSP 2 is a good place to start.  The game runs really well, and the foundations of the systems are solid.  You are buying into early access, so there is some jank, but the game will also grow with your capabilities.  I started KSP 1 incredibly early in it\'s beta (pre steam) and envy new players ability to watch a game develop along with their understanding and skills in the game.   The game looks great, and there is so much information provided for the player that there is always an answer for your problem.  If you are at all curious I would say go for it, as long as you are okay with playing early access.  I would not have said that about this game a month ago, but it\'s now at the stage where I can say it has a strong enough foundation to be genuinely fun.  Why play Kerbal?  You will pretty much get an education in the fundamentals of orbital mechanics, while remaining accessible, and fun.  I have several hundred hours in KSP 1 and can honestly say I have learned more from that game than any college course I\'ve taken.  If you have kids who you want to teach about science and the process of discovery I can also recommend this as a teaching tool that is fun, and honestly pretty hilarious for kids.  I play with my 6 year old and my two 3 year olds, and they LOVE this game.  They prefer KSP2 to KSP1, I think because of the visuals, and sound.  Veterans: The game has stabilized immensely and will now be my primary place for playing the game.  It is still early in development, and they have a ways to go before they are at parity with KSP1 but a couple of my biggest gripes with the old engine have been addressed and I cannot go back.  Stability in and out of warp, spinning ships not turning into garbage, the amount of information provided up from by the UI.  I also think the game looks and sounds way better as well.  I totally get why people would be uncomfortable dropping money on KSP2 if they have a fully modded and stable KSP1, and those people should probably wait.  But I find this a better playing game, and the way the engine handles warp, and extreme physics much more bearable, and can\'t go back. If your biggest issue with the game at release was frame rate, buddy I\'ve got some great news for you.  Game runs like butter (mostly) now. Great job Intercept!',''),(1106,'Pros - The game has a lot more character than 1- The tutorials the game offers are \"cute\". - The foundation and underlying physics systems of the game seems to be better than KSP 1 in every way.- It\'s pretty- Runs well on medium-high settings (Nvidia Recommended Settings) on my GTX 3060TI. It is ram hungry though, so having at least 16 is a must, 32 if you can swing it.- PROCEDURAL PARTS!- Exploration is good. Incomplete, but very promising. Cons - There are still some annoying bugs. Only major ones I ran into was the orbit lines going away, Turns out it\'s because the game thinks the ship is on the ground, so recovering the ship and launching again fixed it. The other being parts randomly not being in the same place when reverting or loading a save.- The Maneuver planner needs an overhaul. It\'s a big step back from KSP 1. The planner UI, where you can see the after state of your obit needs to come back. I dislike dragging on the node.- SAS is very twitchy with planes. I can fly them no problem with it off, but as soon as I turn it on, the plane starting \"bouncing\" in the air and is very twitchy. Mixed - It\'s pretty obvious there are a lot of \"holes\" in the content when you\'re playing it. On the other hand, it\'s fairly close to KSP 1, just in a different direction. So it\'s obvious you\'re playing a game with lots of stuff in the works, but it also feels like a game with stuff in the works because there is a lot of obviously missing content.- There are fewer parts. Personally I think this is fine. It makes the game easier to get into and I\'m not overwhelmed with choice. The procedural parts do help fill some of the gaps.- The new UI looks nice, but is less informative and intuitive than the old one. There are a lot of good COL features though. I think this is something that can be improved by just having the devs give some HS kids $50 and some pizza to let them watch them play the game for a day. Wish List - More Procedural parts! I think having procedural tanks should be a minimum. Then instead of unlocking \"bigger\" tanks, you unlock tanks made of different materials that are suited for different applications, like in RP-1.- I want there to be an option (another mode) like Exploration, but with a more realistic progression. Starting with crewed space flights feels a bit weird to this day. I would love to start with sounding rockets, then sats, before sending fruit flies and dogs into orbit before moving onto crewed space flights. Then lock tech behind contracts that are linked to the progression. Maybe the first crewed flights are x-planes to make planes matter more.- A built in simulator for builds. The cheat menu is nice and all, but I think it would be great to be able to run a simulation from the VAB.- Give me a way to actually pilot recoverable stages or do air launches. There is a mod for KSP 1 called FMRS that will drop a save for you when your craft splits into more than one controllable piece. You can fly one of them, then \"time travel\" back to separation and fly the other. It stitches the saves back together for you after. Some sort of \"time travel\" feature could probably be done much better by the devs, and I would love it, particularly because I love doing air launched rocket planes.- Give me better waypoints. They don\'t seem to exist in the game right now. I want it to work like the waypoint manager mod for ksp 1, where you can set waypoints on anything in the game. I can\'t even set a waypoint for the KSC right now to find my way home after flying a plane without opening the map. This is desperately needed.- Improve the UI, particularly the manuver node editor.- MORE SCIENCE! There needs to be more science experiments in the game. In particular I would love to see some experiments that need to be left running for extended periods. Days, months or even years and give you a steady flow of science while they are running.There are some other things on my \"wishlist\", but they were already announced, so I left them out. Verdict, is it worth getting now? The verdict is, I\'m enjoying myself with this game. It offers a bit more character than the first one and while it\'s not quite matching 1 in many areas, it also offers a slightly different experience. If it\'s on sale, it could be worth picking up if you know you will get it anyways.

I finished the game at the 1.0 release and haven\'t touched the game since until about 2 weeks ago after I got a PC.After playing the game on PC, I can say that Grounded is one of my top 10 favourite games of all time.Combat, Weapons and Armour:The combat system, with perfect blocking, is a fantastic way to reward players for learning attack patterns and timing parry\'s allowing good players to take on the toughest Insects with ease, creating that fun skill ceiling that makes you want to improve to become a Grounded combat master. Different insects have different weaknesses and resistances making the choice of weapon matter. Not only do each weapon type deal different types of damage, but there is also elemental damage as well adding another layer of choice and skill to killing insects. The armour and weapons get stronger the further you progress and all have unique mechanics to give them all a fresh feel and to keep the game play from feeling repetitive. And the layer of combat don\'t stop there, because there are buffs and debuffs that happen depending on the bug you are facing, so don\'t forget to eat a meal and drink a smoothie as these are ways to get extra buffs to help take down enemies easier. So weather you prefer shooting you\'re enemy with a bow made from wasps, or want the clobber them with a club made from ants, or maybe you want to slice them in two with a battleaxe made from candy, Grounded has got something for you.Mutations:Mutations are a game mechanic that work amazing with the core game adding extra abilities to the player for as long as the player chooses. you unlock different mutations throughout the game by doing different challenges around the yard. Want to run faster, mutation for that, want more hauling strength (carry more stuff), mutation for that, want to minions to fight for you, mutation for that. Mutations are a fantastic and integral addition to the game.Story:I will keep the story section spoiler free. The story progresses at a good pace with different data pieces to help piece together the story. I love how it gives the choice to the player on what to do, but guides them so you don\'t end up never progressing. As you play though the game, different areas of the map have locations you will visit and you get rewarded by unlocking items that will help you take on tougher insects. They really tried to make the story interesting with the players who want more from the story being able to search around for extra pieces of data, whereas if you just want to get through the main story stuff and speed through the progression, you can do that too. It doesn\'t hold your hand and baby you through the game, but doesn\'t require a wiki or youtube video to know what to do next. It\'s hard to talk about the story without spoiling it, so you will have to find out yourself if you play this game.Exploration:finding things to discover is easy because of how much the map is packed full of things to find, with raw science, milk molars, sca.b\'s, new resources, and much more which can give you upgrades, weapons, armour or other goodies. Landmarks can be found around the map and give you a reward for finding them which is a fun way to motivate people to explore the backyard. But if you weren\'t convinced to explore the backyard, you can find a plethora of different insects. From spiders, to beetles, to ants. Some insects fly, some crawl, and some swim. Some friendly, some neutral and some angry. The variety in insects makes the game so easy to sink hours into, learning and mastering the all the insects.Building:The building is easy to understand and has plenty of different things you can build, allowing for creativity. you could build whatever you want really. I\'m currently building a basketball stadium because basketball is a playable sport (to a certain extent) in Grounded. Build yourself a base anywhere you like, just be careful because you may annoy the local insects. Building is what can make a play through of the game a long a fun process, giving you a reason to keep playing after you beat the game to 100%. But if gathering resources doesn\'t tickle your fancy, Grounded has a creative mode allowing you to build whatever you want right away.Bosses:I don\'t want to spoil any bosses because the feeling of walking into a fight not knowing whats coming is a thrilling experience you will get only once. The bosses are all unique, with some being optional and some tied to the story. After facing all of them I can safely say that fighting these bosses with not disappoint. Fighting these bosses give unique and powerful drops making it feel worth fighting the optional bosses. I was not disappointing when facing these almighty foes.Extra challenge:Last little thing to talk about is those who want a challenge. Although there is a hard difficulty (Whoa!), I like a real challenge. At the end of the game you receive a report card, it basically shows stats like \"insects killed\" and \"Deaths\". You also get a grade based on how much of the game you completed (including the optional stuff). So for those who are completionists like me, Grounded has a completionist challenge with a steam achievement tied to it.Grounded will forever be a game I will look back on be glad I got to play it. I highly recommend you play this game.9.5/10Thanks for reading this if you did.',''),(1133,'Good game perfect with more then 1 player and very fun 10/10',''),(1134,'How short \"people\" go about their daily lives.

However, ongoing updates and community support have significantly addressed these issues.Progression Challenges: While cross-play is a commendable feature, progression challenges may arise due to differences in skill levels between PC and console players, impacting the overall balance in multiplayer matches.Overall, Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Steam is a treasure trove for Halo aficionados and a solid entry point for newcomers.

You can do things like hack a terminal and toggle the security so it\'ll shoot all the previously happy workers in city hall just minutes into playing without realizing what you did. Vents are everywhere, and they all connect, just not always in a logical fashion—a huge portion of ducting went through my character\'s apartment in the opening tutorial sequence which I thought was just commentary on dystopian lives.At the end of my session my main takeaway is that it feels very, very buggy, to the point where I\'m not having fun. Yes, it\'s early access. Yes, I understand that it\'s not done. I just would have trouble personally charging for this at the moment since it feels like a demo, or a proof of concept, with a few buffered edges on the highly visible things.I REALLY like the case system, and I think that this is the correct sort of game to use this kind of system since linear games will just... railroad the experience and make it oppressively sterile. It still needs a bit more work, though. The UX is not absolutely horrible, but there needs to be a cleaner, faster way to sort through your collected bits of info. It also needs to not automatically link some things, as it removes the \"ah ha!\" moments, while also accepting alternative but comparable forms of comparable evidence, rather than just examining a body to glean all the relevant details each time (at least in the case of murders).I was hoping for an emergent gameplay experience, and in some ways it is; you can generate a city (very cool), go into any building (very cool), dig through people\'s stuff (cool, but limited variety), and solve cases from multiple sources (cool, but also lacks some variety). NPCs have lives, which is also neat, but they are very sterile in practice if they aren\'t involved with a case.This feels like an excellent framework that needs a couple of years to really flesh out the generative stuff you have to sift through, like vmails, help postings, etc., to make it feel less like Skyrim style \"Radiant\" quests with \"infinite gameplay\". It\'s cool for a bit, and definitely worth experiencing for an hour or so, but it kind of feels like a tech demo to show off the impressive map generation.In ~3 hours I played, I ran into the following notable things:Multiple containers doors/intractable objects not spawning properly, with objects floating in the air or in full viewMany areas are generated with very narrow geometry, making some areas difficult to squeeze around (odd for things like laundromats, etc)Changing or confusing descriptions of NPCsNames in written things, like vmails, either being \"[first name]\" or \"  \" occasionallyHarsh in-world lighting and art style make it difficult to accurately ID folks based on their photosHandcuffed NPCs offering to talk, but not allowing me toUnable to collect prints from handcuffed or unconscious NPCsContainer interactions taking precedence over notes without shoving it into my character\'s faceNPCs phasing through walls or tight geometryObvious evidence, like spent casings for rounds, not really matteringThe ability to buy a gun, and hold it like a banana in your hand(This one\'s a design choice, but one that works against immersion—you\'re an ex-cop!)Ambiguous labeling for things (\"Security\" vs \"Surveillance\", etc.) that, honestly, could be labelled better in generalThe gun design thing is a real confusing choice. From what I\'ve read, it\'s so NPCs have a way to buy murder weapons. It\'s claimed that using a weapon would potentially mess with \"proc gen\", presumably because you can kill NPCs that way, but I\'ll argue that your ability to buy them only dilutes the experience and serves to waste the player\'s time and currency.As I opened: you can have turrets gun down people indiscriminately. Just lead people and get them shot. There\'s a sword, too, which makes even less sense for an ex-cop analog to use, but it\'s perfectly viable and readily available. Why hamstring yourself from including another noir/crime story trope to throw into the mix? The game needs more than it has now, not less.Design choices like this lead me to believe that it\'s possible that the game could be finished and end up in that strange middle ground—hyper immersive (or \"realistic\"), but with a very narrow scope in mind that prevents it from becoming the full-spectrum sandbox like it\'s absolutely primed to be. On top of this, performance wasn\'t anything to write home about. DLSS inclusion is nice, since the game chunks real hard in some cases (X5900 / 3080). There were some performance issues while walking around, guessing it was a loading issue as things would pop in as I went around corners, etc.TL;DRSuper ambitious, cool idea, but narrow focus and confusing, expressively made design choices. Execution to be determined. I\'d sit on the sidelines until this one makes it to the finish line.',''),(1160,'Gosh.

While it\'s not without its flaws, this game is a bold leap into what feels like uncharted territory, breaking away from the well-trodden paths of standard video game formulas.The freedom to approach cases in various ways—whether through breaking into seedy hotel rooms or analyzing a discarded receipt—offers a level of immersion that is as rare as it is captivating. Each case presents a new puzzle, with varying culprits and clues, challenging players to truly think like detectives.The game\'s commitment to a fully simulated world is its crowning achievement. The level of detail in tracking each citizen\'s life—from their daily routines to their personal interactions—adds an unprecedented depth to the gameplay. This meticulous design invites players to lose themselves in the game\'s rich, noir-esque universe, making every discovery and piece of gathered evidence feel earned.While \'Shadows of Doubt\' is ambitious in its scope, it\'s this very ambition that gives it a raw, unpolished charm. It\'s a game that isn\'t afraid to take risks, and it\'s these risks that make it stand out in a crowded market. The potential for growth and refinement is vast, and with continued support from the developers and the community, this game could evolve into a benchmark for innovative gaming.In conclusion, \'Shadows of Doubt\' is more than just a game; it\'s a daring venture into the future of interactive storytelling and immersive gameplay. It\'s a must-play for anyone yearning for something different, something that challenges the norms and offers a glimpse into what the future of gaming could hold.

She drew her Lazarus-5 and opened fire. No reaction from the crowd. As I attempted to defend myself with my trusty truncheon, several others drew as well and began firing on me (ColePowered please add self-defense laws). I was gunned down... but my tracker remained.After I awoke, I frantically scanned my map, hoping to locate the perpetrator, and there, I saw it. A green dot. Approaching Basement 01 Benitez House. I ran as fast as I could, hoping to catch her in her apartment, where she would have no reinforcements. Going through the door was a no-go. What if she was still armed? I\'d have to sneak through the vents.As I approached the first grate, I looked through, and there she was. Pissing. I waited, and soon she got up, washed her hands, and began brushing her teeth. Directly under the vent. I burst through, truncheon in hand, and put her to the ground. Then the cuffs came out. With the criminal subdued, I searched her apartment for any signs of her true identity. And there it was. A work rota. Street Stall Vendor, 8:30-20:30, Monday-Friday.Eliza Burton.

Probably should\'ve used the Black Market instead.',''),(1177,'Incredible so far and I still haven\'t even scratched the surface of this game in 20 hrs. I give my glowing recommendation.',''),(1178,'You play as a student in the most famous magical school of wizardry, and will follow along the expected milestones of the academic year—you’ll attend classes, learn new spells and skills, help both teachers and classmates and unravel a mystery regarding a powerful enemy. It’s as Harry-Potter-esque as it gets. If you loved the movies and books, this game is a must-play.The gameplay is just as you’d expect for a student in the HP universe, complete with the selection process in charge of a talking hat, socializing with (or antagonizing) your colleagues, wandering around the castle and getting into trouble. Short of impersonating Potter himself, this is the closest experience you will get to enrolling in a Hogwarts school year. Of course, there is no Voldemort, but the story is sufficiently similar, and you will still feel like the prophetically-foretold boy who lived.You can customize your student’s looks, clothing and even your magic wand and broom. The options are not a lot, but still serviceable enough. Naturally, you can belong to any of the four Hogwarts Houses, and you will be given the corresponding uniform and colored accessories. You’ll find a lot of clothes in your adventures, and each item provides different bonuses to your character. Interestingly, you can change the looks and keep the features, which means that you can always look the way you want, and have the combat perks you most like or need. This is an excellent feature.Despite the emphasis on the wizarding experience, I believe the star of the show is Hogwarts itself. The castle is huge, rendered beautifully, and chock-full of secrets and places to explore. Ever wanted to wander around the school and grounds and see the places barely mentioned in the movies? Now’s your chance. And it’s every bit as fantastic as you imagine. Discovery is the name of the game, and every single location you’ve heard of in the books is here, and then some. Mind you, this is Hogwarts, not London—so no Ministry of Magic and such. Want to dare visiting the Forbidden Forest at night, looking for the dangerous arachnid lair? Try your luck at finding the common rooms of the other houses? Venture into the Library’s forbidden section? You can do all that. NPCs are quirky, diverse and in tune with the Potterverse. You will finally get to meet Peeves!Interestingly, there’s no curfews or hard enforced rules. Considering this is a school, and the importance of norms in the movies, this is weird—but perfectly understandable, from a gameplay standpoint. Still, there are moments when stealth is the better approach to trouble, and the student is perfectly capable of hiding and defeating opponents while unseen.Unlike with many games these days, I found myself avoiding fast travel almost every time. It’s nice to walk to the surrounding villages, and even nicer to fly there on your magic broom. You will find merchants, wild animals, rogue trolls, abandoned ruins and dark wizard camps. You can even explore ancient tombs, and there are many puzzles scattered all over the place for you to solve, courtesy of the late Merlin. Solving them will grant bonuses that aid you in several ways.The story is interesting, usually predictable and mildly convoluted. It also echoes Potter\'s journey with small twists here and there. The dark figure of the mysterious looming enemy is still present, only this time the goblins play a bigger part. As usual, there are undertones of real-life problems, like racism and segregation.An interesting choice regarding ethics is the use of the Unforgivable Curses. This topic is dealt with somewhat lightly, but the implied values and decisions are still there. Will you become a pre-teen murderous criminal and use these curses indiscriminately? Your choice. As for me, I decided I wouldn’t—and this meant a whole branch of the skill tree was unavailable to me. While you can’t pickpocket and rob to your heart’s desire, you can most definitely steal from every home in Hogsmeade, even in front of the owner, with no consequence at all. From a modern gaming perspective, I expected something less immersion-breaking.The music is fantastic. Not Williams, but deeply reminiscent of his work. Once again, the similarity was pushed to the limit, stopping only short of exorbitant royalties. You’ll recognize the notes and motifs over and over, and it’s never invasive in terms of gameplay. Some comments from your character can get repetitive, though—and the flu stations suffer from the same.The Room of Requirement is at your disposal as your main base of operations. You can decorate it to your heart’s desire, and gradually expand its size and functionality as the story progresses. Different props and magical stations will become available to find or purchase, and you can place them wherever you want. Eventually, you’ll get your own magical spaces to keep fantastic beasts like the famed magizoologist of the movies. The potion-making mechanics, however, are cumbersome and—at least to me—almost completely unnecessary.True, there is little variety in the enemy department. Combat mechanics are a bit simplistic, but serviceable. The student is not very agile, but it works well. Sometimes the enemies will feel bland. Unlike Voldemort and his minions, these guys lack depth and personality, and you will frequently end up fighting and defeating mindless golems and statues that always act and look the same.The graphics are really beautiful. And not only the world: the map, the cards, everything contributes to the gorgeous look of the game. A general sense of quality can be seen everywhere. The details are wonderful and always in line with the Potter universe.The voice acting is excellent, varied in mood and accents. The only ugly detail is the sound editing, especially the pitch slider for the main character’s voice, but this is also present with other characters and even cats. This produces weird sound aberrations that are sadly somewhat common.I did encounter a pair of bugs, but not game-breaking ones. In a weird case where my character clipped into a wall because I tried to use the broom too close to it, the reverse action solved the problem. I am aware of the complaints by other players, but for me it was a stutter-free experience, with no crashes at all, although texture popping can break the immersion from time to time. Loading times are not annoying save for the \"shades loading\" that always happens at launch.I used the Xbox One wireless controller to excellent results.In terms of mechanics, Hogwarts Legacy is plagued by a sign of the times: lots of errands, collecting items, fetching quests, and the like take place in a very large open world. The beautiful castle and scenery help in that department, and you\'ve got travel points, a flying broom and a magical steed to aid you in your travels. Thankfully, there are no microtransactions, gems, crystals, or any other annoying token currency so common today. Sadly, no Quidditch!I could not help but to feel a little empty at times—in Hogwarts Legacy, the sense of “game-ness” is a bit painful, given the wondrous world and potential for immersion. The game could be much better with a bit more complexity, from more interaction with the environment to maybe better customization options. However, the game is complete and functional as it is, and I understand why these design decisions were made.The price is a little high to my liking, but with a 15-20% off it would be fair.Playing Hogwarts Legacy has left me a sense of wonder I have seldom felt in a game lately. Even the story itself evokes that of Harry, and purposefully so. But it works. If you are a Potter fan, this is a must buy. You\'ll thoroughly enjoy the experience. This is the best alternative yet to be a Hogwarts student.Charmingly recommended.',''),(1179,'I completely beat the game thus at this point it doesn\'t hide any more secrets from me, tho it doesn\'t change the fact that it had been a huge fun and Hogwarts Legacy was the game I really needed and I don\'t exclude replaying it in the future as it\'s become my personal favorite game of the 2023. It\'s not perfect, but absolutely deserved a positive review!Pros: beautiful, addicting world full of satisfying, but often undemanding fights. Using magic was exteremely fun and gave multiple possibilities of having a great combat experience (you can try stealth, defensive plants, potions, choose to learn unforgivable curses or just use mastered spells) quite nice character development-you can spend talent points on improving your magic skills and upgrading your equipment items. absolutely stunning beasts and landscapes offering tons of activities, side quests, puzzles, exploration the Room of Requirements being in general your base  where you can prepare your gear, brew potions, grow plants and breed beasts. It can be also decorated both by conjuring items from the collections and by changing its style with the help of your own slave, I mean house elf  engaging and fun side quests full of unexpected twists and sometimes heartbreaking situations compensating for the boring main story quests unlimited in time or the main story despite not giving actual moral consequences of your actions,in some cases you can get a better reward and/or piss off the NPCs large freedom of action the possibilities of customizing your character (from their appearance, voice to the gear they use) various and interesting side characters, at least some of them fun, but again quite simple puzzles a versatile game for many hours and for every generation. Thanks to the fact that you play as a fifth-grade student, the plot seems more mature and at the same time it gives the opportunity to learn all the basics. a decent optimization, beautiful graphics and atmospheric musicCons: my biggest complaint is in spite of a huge level of immersion, the lack of an actual moral system. We can pour out dark magic all over Hogwarts and no one will even bat an eyelid. And no, we can\'t be bad per se, just rude. Even if you choose a bad ending  and decide to open the repository, except for the mysterious death of Professor Figg, there are no consequences and you can still win the House Cup and be praised for what you\'ve done. There is no penalty for robbing houses or using unforgivable curses. I think the biggest consequence I had was Natty asking calmly BLOODY HELL HOW DID YOU LEARN THIS SPELL  choosing a House is a small matter, apart from making friends from your House  faster I suppose or getting an additional quest when it comes to Hufflepuff. little varied life at Hogwarts,  the first night will be the last you spend in your dorm . I feel there could be more interactions with fellow students and more activities within the house you belong to (you can\'t really storage the loots or use your room). Also the character can\'t sit, so furniture like sofa and chair are just a decoration. boring main story. I get you\'re supposed to feel like a gifted chosen one, but the result was average for me. no actual storyline from Ravenclaw there could be more potion ingredients etc. so it\'d be more complicated to find them many NPCs were boring, unlikable and poorly written characters I won\'t miss, like for example  I wasn\'t even sorry when Figg died  no Quidditch (maybe a chance for a DLC in coop in the nearest future?) you can\'t romance Sebastian and Poppy :// but I get, it\'s a family friendly game cutscenes in Ancient Magic and Merlin\'s Trials spots cannot be skipped no photo mode therefore you can\'t take beautiful screenshots:(It was a great adventure that gets you back to your childhood dreams and reminds you that your inner child is still there, evoking many pleasant memories. As a Potterhead I\'m really impressed by the whole universe and how smart the devs created a story before the chosen one and only Harry Pottah. Play it and see for yourself:)',''),(1180,'The game is entertaining and fun for first few hours, then it gets repetitive and boring with shallow RPG elements and not so interesting main character with boring dialogues.

There should be points docked for getting caught entering or leaving the forbidden forestNo guards at night in campus.(only one quest had them) Wished they had the 5th years go on regular patrols and getting caught will send you back to the dorm and dock points from your houseSummaryI know I am writing this review pretty late. It has been a while since I last played Hogwarts. The way I feel about this game is that this game feels like it needed more time in the oven. I never kept up with the development of the progress so I had no expectations and this game came out of nowhere for me. I heard that it has been delayed quite a bit. The castle is amazing. The exploration of Hogwarts is best thing about the game. About halfway through the game I did start to get bored. I felt like skipping scenes because they felt like filler. The side quests were a mix of bland and aright. transmogs are pretty cool but the gearing is terrible. I swapped out my gear every few encounters. upgrading or modding isn\'t worth it for it as you quickly swap out you gear as soon you get the materials for it. This game feels like It could have been a pretty good mmo. just thinking about that kinda wants that. raids would look so cool having a bunch of wizards shooting their wands at a boss. It is a hard game to truly recommend. I am still conflicted whether I regret my purchase or not. I guess I have mixed feelings.',''),(1184,'Not a perfect game, but I really enjoyed my time with it. 8/10: Highly Recommended.A quick preface: I haven\'t thought about Harry Potter since like... 2008? It\'s been a while!Pros- Excellent Visuals- Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are an absolute joy to explore. I spent WAY longer than the game expected me to JUST exploring and finding all the collectible field guide pages I could.- Transmog is available right away and at no cost. You don\'t have to go into battle looking like a clown just because the stats are good. You can change them on the fly anytime you want! - The combat system is great! Took me a minute to get into the groove, but once it clicked it absolutely clicked!- The spells are fun to play around with. Experimenting to see what spells combo well against a given enemy was really enjoyable.- Respectable difficulty. It\'s not too hard to push me to frustration, and not so easy it puts me to sleep. In the opening hours I found myself healing a lot... later on I barely took damage. I\'d say it veers on the \"easier\" difficulty side but fine none the less. No harm in rewarding player skill.- Some of the bosses were visually impressive and fun to fight.- Story was fine. There were moments it felt needlessly dragged out. However, I was distracted with other things.- Flying around on a broom felt good! The controls were odd... but I got used to them quickly.- I encountered very few glitches and bugs. Far less than I was expecting.- Minus the occasional hiccup towards the end of the game Hogwarts Legacy ran smoothly. Minimal performance issues.- This game doesn\'t require you to know anything about Harry Potter to enjoy it. There are loads of easter eggs for fans of the series to enjoy. However, not recognizing the easter egg doesn\'t take away from the experience. I had forgotten SO much over this last decade and even then... a lot came rushing back. Was never punished for forgetting stuff though.- Some great characters and side quests representing 3 of the 4 houses. Natsi and Sebastian are clear standouts.- I was giggling silly during the Polyjuice potion section. That was exactly what I wanted from Hogwarts school mischief.- Taking place a good hundred years before the events of the Harry Potter series was a good idea. Helps keep the stories out of each-others way.Cons- Enemy variety is low, lot of quantity over quality in the later battles.- Puzzles variety is good, but not quite good enough. It reminded me of the Korok puzzles in Zelda.. There\'s just SO MANY of them... so despite a decent lineup on paper it feels like they are repeated over and over again. Same issue here.-GEAR LIMITS! Why? Why does there NEED to be a limit on gear like that? Do you have any idea how SICK I am of dropping everything, fast traveling to a shop, and dumping my entire inventory every 5-10 minutes!? I can shove a monster 3 times my size into a handbag... I THINK i can carry one more hat!!!! Even with the Merlin Trials, this was ANNOYING!!!- I did not enjoy the Stealth mechanics in this game. Total snooze fest.- House points didn\'t really matter like they did in the books/movies. That was disappointing and makes some of my actions feel like they had no consequence.- No house specific quests... total missed opportunity there. - No Quidditch. There is an In-universe reason for this... but every time a characters mentions it, (and they do often) that feeling that there\'s something missing wells up in me again.- The Magical Beasts were cute! Yet, I barely even touched the upgrade system... simply because I didn\'t have to! Every few minutes I\'d find better gear than I was wearing and just swapped it out. As a result, I feel like I wasted my time in the vivariums.- The Room of Requirement was neat... but I mostly ignored it. I never got to invite anybody into the room so it was just there to grow plants and brew potions really...- The hamlets scattered around the world are... uninteresting. Could\'ve used a bit more love to make them memorable.- Where\'s the Whomping Willow? I wanted to get punched by a tree!In conclusion, I think I can say this is the best Harry Potter game ever made. The world is a joy to explore, the combat system is engaging, and the story has good presentation. The game is mostly held back by its own RPG systems and those couple of things it\'s missing.',''),(1185,'This game is absolutely incredible.I did not think it would be possible to make a mainstream game that is actually good, in this day and age of crappy AAA games. But there has been an incredible amount of work and passion that has gone into getting this game just right, reflected by the massively long credits.Overall I was impressed at how many elements of the original and best games were still kept, whilst adding in new aspects to the gameplay. The mystique and intrigue of the wizarding world is perfectly pulled off in and it keeps you entertained for hours.

So, don\'t expect to 100% this one.* The descriptions for some of the \"dueling achievements\" are... obtuse, but it\'s a minor issue.',''),(1189,'An absolute gaming masterpiece.

Otherwise - don\'t bother. It\'s the same repetitive open-world boring design that was outdated ten years ago. Honestly, I got distracted by pretty Hogwarts to think before buying, and it was actually fine until I was put into the open world 1-1,5 hour in. Then it was so underwhelming I felt that I\'m wasting my time. I googled to see if it will get better, but no, it\'s literally a ubisoft game in HP universe. It\'s just sad.

It says I have 30 hours in it, but no joke, probably near half of those are from me pausing and going AFK cause I got bored. Now, don\'t get me wrong, I love open world repetitive task stuff as much as anyone else, but this game fails to satisfy in so many different areas. The Hogwarts castle itself is honestly amazing. The rest of the game, however, is.... lame. Unfortunate. I feel like I would enjoy this game a lot more if I was younger.My background: Ive read the books, seen most of the movies, and played Order of the Phoenix on XBOX 360. That one was pretty good for its time iirc. I would say I\'m a fan, but not crazy about it. Pros: If we are just talking strictly Hogwarts here, and nothing they did outside caste grounds, this game has plenty of secrets, people, side quests and collectibles, etc. to keep you engaged and mesmerized by the truly amazing castle. The game truly feels *cool* to play, and makes you feel immersed most of the time.- Great graphics.- Exploration is great.- Music is great.- Immersive. Cons: Game just gets boring man, and its disappointing. So many things are just lame.- Inventory system, loot system, and economy in general is dumb. I guess there is plenty of preppy British clothing and wizard cloaks and things that fits the style, but man, the transmog system sucks. You have to manually change the appearance of every new item back to how you had it previously.... There is no immersive reason to be equipping ridiculous looking gear for stats, its all made up anyway, why make this process so INSANELY annoying??? Limited loot spaces as well makes you constantly either go find vendors to sell all your trash, go to your room to break them down for materials, or go do endless remote tasks to increase your storage space.... This system is so bad in so many ways....- Combat. The system itself is not bad per-se. Its just basic, easy, and needs to be focused on WAY LESS than they do. You fight the same 5 enemies the entire game, and if for some sadistic reason you play on a higher difficulty, you will just be spamming for so many hours in this game. The system is so shallow, that caring about gearing is just pointless, so it makes all the collecting, economy, crafting system, and consumables feel like a waste of effort.- Story is written like its E for everyone (literally rated ESRB 13+). I understand why, but YIKES the story is just so boring. Your character is just a saint who is so uninteresting. The side character design is fine, its just the story lines both main and side are beyond boring. You feel like you are going through the motions....- World outside of Hogwarts. Why? Why is it so big? So I can fly on a broom with awful controls more? No wonder they didn\'t make Quidditch, their flying mechanics are BARELY serviceable as a basic means for transportation. But yeah, the rest of the open world is WAY too big with literally nothing in it except endless random check box style side objectives. Who knows how long 100%ing the game would take. The storylines try and send you through the different areas, but I don\'t see the point. - Quantity > Quality. I would rather the game have less areas, less objectives, less random overlapping spells, and focus more on quality hand crafted areas and story, not just empty forests for an excuse to add 1 of 10 spawn points for a specific animal that literally nobody will care about.- The custom room and animal stuff. You are tasked with going through so many tutorials on collecting animals to farm materials around the world and keep them happy and create your own personal player housing I guess, but the whole thing feels pointless. Its like, Fallout 4 level of pointless. Like I said earlier, there really isnt rewards to shoot for anyway with crafting or modifying gear. Its all a waste of time and not satisfying in the slightest.I really tried getting invested. I really did. The fact that a beautiful Hogwarts game with open world and flying in it can manage to get so boring so fast that I can\'t even finish it is pretty sad. Some people love it. I can\'t call it a bad game, but ive had it installed for 6+ months now, and I\'m just never in the mood for it. Maybe I\'ll revisit it later, but Ive already seen enough of the castle and stuff to get the gist.

I\'m pretty sure the RNG is unbelievably wonky because either every roll goes in my favour or every roll goes against both of which detract from the experience. I don\'t think I\'ve had many games where if we were able to look at the stats they\'d be remotely near balance. I know it\'s RNG but surely that has to happen at some point? So if you want the full Blood Bowl experience of being salty cause of dice or feeling like an absolute BB god because of them then this is going to give you both those feeling in abundance. The lack of league tools is a huge issue because it means you just can\'t really play with your friends which was the real joy of BB2. The micro transactions I don\'t care about, the unstable servers I can live with, the waiting 10 minutes for a game I can handle. I\'m just sad that Cyanide had a chance to do sometime great, with what I think is the best rule set blood bowl has ever had, but the experience is so horribly skewed by the absolute nonsense of the crazy RNG.',''),(1207,'It\'s basically the tabletop game.',''),(1208,'Fail to load into the game get banned from playing - current experience of this patch',''),(1209,'I preordered this game and from what I\'ve seen so far it\'s both better and worse in some areas compared to Blood Bowl 2 as of the current patch of this review so I\'m only going to give a few exemples.some of the good and bad parts (in my opinion) are like this.Good:#1 you can jump over downed players even without the jump skill (haven\'t done it outside the tutorial but I\'ve seen the option for that).#2 it doesn\'t give you the option to use the apotecary on hired players for the match + won\'t give SPP to those players either (if I remember correctly dead players can\'t get MVP).#3 the Nuffle Prayers are interesting when they happen, but with my luck it\'s usually 4-6 in favor for the opponent in my games and when it is in my favor it helps both sides or causes most of my opponents to concede.#4 the coach you have for the team can give a set of animated emotes/reactions.#5 it\'s much easier to customise the players and their names.Bad:#1 there is technically microtranactions in the game that uses Warpstones, but you can unlock some for free through the battlepasses which are only used for mostly cosmetics, different cheerleaders and coaches + unlock the new team on level 1 battlepass instead of level 50 battlepass.#2 there are a couple of bugs and glitches remaining (most of the launch ones have been fixed) where the 2 most annoying ones for me are A: the visual glitch that shows the players moving to a different spot rather than the spot they actually went or the circle showing where the ball is sometimes shows the circle on a different spot, B: if you click a player to move to a different spot before or during kickoff event it sometimes freezes where it usually helps to right click (on mouse) before clicking the player again to unfreeze it.#3 if you want to pause the game then there\'s no longer a chat where you can tell the opponent why you are going to pause the game to let them know if it\'ll be long enough so they can do a toilet break or go grab something to eat/drink.#4 after spending the petty coins then you can\'t use your actual gold to buy some advantages if you have more gold than you can spend (I guess they did a way to spend the gold though team/coach expenses that you roll a d6 if you will lose gold or not.#5 you can no longer get rid of team re:rolls after buying them if you get enough good skills that you don\'t need as many team re:rolls.so in summary from my games so this is based on my opinion:if you easly get angry when it goes bad for you in games then id say this game is a 8.5 out of 10 in salt level.in gameplay wise it\'d say 7.5 out of 10 due to some bugs and glitches + stuff I haven\'t mentioned.in visual graphics compared to Blood Bowl 2 it\'s either 9 or 9.5 out of 10.in audio wise it\'s 8 out of 10.The controlls for the players compared to Blood Bowl 2 then it\'s 5 out of 10 due to it can be confusing to use or read how to use them.',''),(1210,'Don\'t be experimental like me, just play Blood Bowl 2. By the time I had a \"feel\" for the game, 3 hours passed.It\'s unbearable. The biggest criminal is the slow animation times, even if the game \"trys\" to refund the clock, I refuse to wait 10 seconds for a single damn tackle. That is my number 1 gripe. The game gives you 2 minutes per turn (8 extra minutes, that is a resource) but the game sort of putters, considering what you want, which takes time, YOUR time. And I ask the developers, if I\'m playing against the A.I. why am I being timed? I have no interest in online play, I just like playing Blood Bowl. Oh and with all these issues, its hilarious that they want you to buy a \"battle pass\", get ♥♥♥♥, finish your game before you ask for extra money.Do not be like me and waste $30 on this, it\'s buggy, even the tutorial is bugged, you CANNOT complete the tutorial unless you select Online Mode.

The game still runs extremely slow, plenty of bugs, server lag in menus, responsiveness in clicking units or making selections this is a main issue which turns away new players with the timer being 2minutes default hard to keep under control when it take 5 seconds for any action that should take 1. A lot of features still missing. Also recently departed from the core rules and changed how the team value is caculated for random skills making them cost the same as a chosen skill to prevent a team when the stars align grants them a minor discount in favor of only seeing 3 skills block, dodge, and guard and then bank all your sp and thus eliminating every other skill in this game; absolute dreadful decision.

This most recent update (S4) is basically unplayable with all servers crashing over and over and basic things like inventory and maps not even being accessible or functioning correctly. I would say it\'s an embarrassment to Amazon but this is pretty much how corporations work now. Get way too rich way too fast, expand into areas they no nothing about while claiming to be experts...then put out inferior products that we are just stuck with. All while promising they are listen to customer feedback and trying to get better but they actually get worse and worse. Blatant money grabs are the regular for video games now it seems. Modern capitalism is how much can you scam before people catch on and you dissolve and write it all off with your real money hidden off shore. I\'ll be moving on and not spending anymore money on this game.  It\'s fair enough to say I got my monies worth with the hours but a lot of the time has been spent idly farming waiting for real content to be released which rarely happens. I would not recommend a new player invest time and money into a game that is just going to frustrate them and not really live up to the MMO expectation (a long term game with a large player base and regular worthwhile content). They just keep re-using the same stuff with slightly diff skins and call it new.',''),(1220,'I have played this game nearly everyday since launch. I really wanted to start a game from its infancy and see it evolve into a popular game and be one of the \"OG\" players. At the start there were a LOT of bugs, and gold/item duping. This is the first MMO I have ever played that shut down the trading between players and auction house, and they have done so on multiple occasions. After about a year and a half, things started to improve a little at a time. Season 1 and 2 were mostly enjoyable. However, Seasons 3 and 4 are getting significantly worse. Season 3 wiped the gear from all the prior gameplay. They made it significantly easier to get BiS gear, but significantly more difficult to make any money in the game unless you own territory which generates cash. Regular players struggled to make ends meet, the about of farming needed for materials for end-game crafting was exceeding 10 hours a day, and there was a daily money sink to get the items needed to craft necessary gear for end-game activities. On top of that, the best method of making money previously was selling gear drops from mutated expeditions, but they nerfed this so that almost every drop is now bound to the player and there is nothing to sell. It became a money sink to also do mutations because of the consumables required to do them. They also introduced races and have nearly wiped out invasions as they used to be done. The day-to-day gameplay is forced into specific 2-4 hour sections of the evening and you are no longer able to play how you want, when you want. If you want to push a territory, you can only do so for 45 minutes every 3 days at a specific time. Are you in Europe, Asia, etc? Too bad, you never get to do this content now. Want to do invasions? We only do them in large bulk 3 days on 3 days off, and half the time they are being reset or cancelled. As a strong company you can easily hold 6 territories and milk money from the server with this system as AGS has set a schedule for everything so you are never threatened by over exerting yourself. With the introduction of Season 4, not only was this the buggiest patch I think they never introduced, it had the least content of any major releases. They released new artifacts, which are just gear items that have additional perks. They released a new dungeon that is 10 minutes long, has the most boring end-game boss which is a re-skin of a previous boss, and features 2 extra bosses that also are just re-skins of previous bosses. The dungeon mechanics are just to run through, pull mobs into a clump, and kill them. It is brain dead, and boring. The only savior for Season 4 was the winter event, that they then nerfed so that players will have to log in every day to be able to get enough credit to be able to afford the rewards. This is their version of creating content and making their numbers appear higher. Many of my friends have stopped playing as the meta for pvp is absolute dogwater - everyone is in heavy and has infinite healing and/or CC so it is just a slap fest with no killing. Then they post a video of their roadmap for the next 6 months that has almost nothing on it that would be considered new content. There is nothing to encourage you to continue to play. This is like attending a school field trip where AGS holds your hand through all content, everything is strictly scheduled and there is no freedom of play.',''),(1221,'bought this game cause reviews said they\'ve fixed a ot of the major issues they had on launch but after playing for about an hour, i realised it\'s just not for me.movement felt so janky, I would consider the graphics \"okay\" at best for 2023 standards and the gameplay itself is so meh.so I went ahead and requested for a refund but only the base game is eligible for the refund... and the DLC is the more expensive part of the bundle...so I cant return this game which I hardly touched?',''),(1222,'After 1 500 h in this game, finally i will make my first review about this game :New World is the only MMO with a modern combat system in the worldu can play PVE like a modern Souls Gamesor u can play PVP like a Modern Game CO-OP Game that requires a lot of skills and has the potential to be an ESPORT Competitive gameand New World is the Only MMO that offers this, New World is the best even with its many flaws as an MMO.- if you hate Tab / auto aim, with 20 active abilities, and you love Action combat, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU - if you have only 2 - 4 hours to play in each day, this game for you, don\'t require Hard core or rushing',''),(1223,'its way relaxing than wow also you dont have to contend with activision billizard stupid luncherthe only problem i have with this game is i wish they cared about us Iranian players whom are stuck in our hellish country and playing video games are our only way of expressing some freedom and did not ban our ip adresses.you cannot call your game NEWworld then do something like this to a part of your player base whom are probably way much more dedicated to your game than most of other people from other parts of our own world.',''),(1224,'Hello community!

It\'s a major issue Amazon, a major issue!)- what is the devs reply on this? That they are working on it. How about working on it before asking 66,98€ for the full game?2.

Even though I’m only part way through the third act of the game, I want to get this review done because (a) I want to get this written before the year’s end and/or this award season, (b) I’ll get a badge for posting it during the Steam Awards, and (c) it’s Baldur’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Gate 3! You probably already know everything I’m going to say, so why wait?So, yeah, what we have here is a game that is likely to win multiple “Game of the Year” awards, will be remembered in 2029 as one of the best games of the decade, and will be found on many peoples’ lists of the greatest games of all time. It is an absolute triumph in nearly every possible way, and we should all be grateful that it exists. That may sound hyperbolic, but I mean every word: this game could shake up the gaming landscape as we know it in ways that only benefit us as players. In a world of battle passes, loot boxes, and DLC, here comes Baldur’s Gate 3 with its ♥♥♥♥ swinging: a huge, complete game whose developers have no plans for DLC, whatsoever. Even EActivisionSoft will sit up and take notice when this game continues to exist in the public consciousness for a long time to come.“But slanderoid,” I hear you shrieking into your monitor or phone or PDA or whatever, “we get that you think the game is important, but is it fun?!”Let me answer your question with another question: What other game would have the player walk in on a goblin porking an orc in a barn and then have to kill them to keep them from ripping your team apart in a blue-balled rage? How about having the player talk a mad scientist into performing surgery on himself to avoid fighting him in a boss battle? How about letting a helpful but overly zealous bard pull out your character’s eyeball in an attempt to remove the Yeerk from their head, only to replace it with an eyeball he had in his pocket? Sounds like fun, no? …No? Oh, maybe I could have phrased it better: Yes. This game is fun as hell.You’ll find all of that in this game. Or you won’t. Maybe you’ll find all different stuff. The number of different paths and events in this huge game is genuinely staggering. Normally this is the kind of thing that would give me choice paralysis, forcing me to turn the game off and never come back again. However, since every choice leads to something interesting, surprising, or, yes, fun, I never really felt like I was missing out. Honestly, I just feel like I need to play it again some time and choose completely different options next time.Okay, let’s run down the list of other great stuff in this game: this game is gorgeous, even on my ancient GTX 1080; the characters are believably expressive, adding to the immersion; the music is memorable; the voice acting is excellent; and narratively, this game is immediately gripping and never lets go. Basically, anyone who has a litmus test for what makes a good game, this game passes. It’s almost guaranteed.The story would be nothing, of course, if it wasn’t full of amazingly badass characters. Every member of the player’s party comes with an interesting back story and a set of side quests that will determine their fate as the story unfolds. Seriously, even the suckiest character (Wyll) has a cool story. And, as you’re probably aware, you can romance any of the people on your team and you’ll learn even more about them. I haven’t even mentioned the hordes of NPCs that the player encounters throughout the realm that have full stories of their own.Now, this wouldn’t be one of my reviews without sharing one of my objectively awful opinions that’s likely to leave you completely dumbfounded about how I manage to even play games at all. (Other than saying that Wyll sucks, that is.) So, here it is: I wish there was a setting to bypass all of the dice rolls during conversations. Not just the animation – the whole ass mechanic itself. As someone who doesn’t give two farts about D&D, the dice rolls just feel like a way for the game to keep my character from doing what I want them to do. I’ve been playing this for well over 100 hours (and I’ve only just started Act III, so I’m counting on another few dozen hours, at least) and I’m getting old enough that I’ve begun staring into the face of my own mortality, so I just want the decisions I make in the game to be followed through with – not checked against RNG to see if my decision would work out. In a world where Nabbit and Funky Kong exist, I don\'t think it\'s too much to ask... As it is, I’ve spent a great deal of time sitting in front of the loading screen after reloading my last save because a die roll didn’t go the way I wanted it to.I’ll give you a moment to get your heartrate back to normal. Take ten deep breaths. Do you still feel like smashing your keyboard or phone or stylus or whatever? Okay, take another second. Did you get it out of your system? Okay, let’s get back to it.I know that I was talking up the different, random paths the player can find themselves taking through the story just a little bit ago, but I think the die rolls would be better on my second playthrough. I’d love to see what kind of crazy crap happens when I fail a die roll for telling a bog hag to eat ♥♥♥♥. But, on my first time through, I don’t want the outcome to be out of my hands. I just want to tell her to eat crap and let nature take its course without RNG getting in the way.Okay, I’m done disparaging the fundamental mechanics of TTRPGs. However, I’d be an even crappier reviewer if I didn’t remind readers that this game is huge with hundreds of different possible outcomes in any given moment of the game – so there are bugs. I’ve had the game crash several times, which was frustrating until I remembered to save early and save often.Which brings me to one of my favorite features of this game that I haven’t heard much about. When I first started playing, I tried relying on the autosave to carry me through the game. This was a mistake – it only reliably autosaves when you enter a new map and the maps in this game are (care to take a guess?) huge. Instead, the game allows the player to make manual saves at any time. Have you been battling for way longer than you expected and now your mom is calling you downstairs for dinner? You can save if you need to. Are you in the middle of a conversation with an NPC but your cat has become a puke cyclone, so now you’ve got to step away and get mopping? Save. Are you in the middle of a date with your in-game romantic interest where you can see their nips and you want to come back to it again later – for science? Save, save, save!I know it’s a silly thing to love about a game that is revolutionary in many ways but I’m a simple man. I’d love to see this feature show up in more games in the future. Autosave has come a long, long way but sometimes I’d love to be able to make manual saves whenever I want, too. I want it all!Anyway, that’s enough rambling, I think. This game is fantastic. It’s my game of the year for good reason. (It even beat out Resident Evil 4, an outstanding remake of my favorite game of all time.) Barring financial or health reasons, everyone should play it. That means you. You should play this game. If you’re somehow still on the fence about playing it despite there being over 400,000 positive reviews of the game at the time of writing and, for some reason, this review is the one that is going to tip the scales: play it, for god’s sake!

When Larian announced they are going to release a sequel I was skeptical. Well regarded for its Divinity series, particularly the Original Sin prequels, Larian\'s games while most definitely good, were entirely different breeds of cRPG. Besides, the Throne of Bhaal had concluded the saga perfectly more than 20 years ago. Why create a sequel to a story that didn\'t really need one? Whatever the case an opportunity to return to the Forgotten Realms was not one I could possibly pass on. Time passed and Baldur\'s Gate 3 was released, since then it has been hailed as one of the best, if not the best, cRPGs ever. The bar has been set high. Let\'s see if I can agree.The game starts fairly typically with the character creation screen. It follows a tweaked version of D&D\'s 5th edition ruleset, some of the tweaks, including the changes to character creation, are rather questionable. Alignment is gone and racial differences diminished for poorly defined reasons. Another surprising change was the strangely convoluted way of picking your character\'s sex, which is that you don\'t. Instead, you pick body-type and then genitalia. Those quirks aside, I do wish that the character screens in the game would provide better and more detailed information. It was a bit of a shame I couldn\'t plan my character\'s development without looking up resources online. Whatever the case, there is still enough D&D goodness here to allow for some interesting characters. There is also a selection of pre-made characters, called origins, which will become companions if they are not selected, and a unique origin called the Dark Urge which puts you in the boots of yet another Bhaalspawn. That one is for a second, more morally ambiguous, run.After character creation the game begins in earnest with the protagonist captured and infected by the vile Illithid, aka Mind Flayers, doomed to become one of them. Here, the game really goes all out with the spectacle. Amazing Cthulhu-esque characters and areas that look like something out of an HR Giger book litter the prologue. Adorned with epic battles as the flying ship the protagonist was imprisoned aboard fights its way through the Hells. The game deserves all the praise it gets and more for its graphics and visual design. It is perhaps the first thing one notices but I don\'t think I\'ve seen a classic isometric cRPG that looked this good before. I\'m always quick to say that such games don\'t need to look great, just reasonably pleasant, as long as they play well. But if I can get a game that looks like this and plays well, that\'s unquestionably better. The experience is elevated further by the game\'s excellent music and voice acting. The production values are through the roof. This is triple-A meets old-school done right. After the prologue, the game follows the now infected protagonist and their party, as they make their journey towards the great city of Baldur\'s Gate. On the way, they encounter more and more people infected by the Mind Flayer parasites and become embroiled in a suitably grand conflict that may decide the fate of Faerun. The game is divided in 3 main acts, each located in a different area. Early on the player has little knowledge of the grand plot brewing in the shadows and the game does an excellent job conveying this feeling of uncertainty and mystery. It bombards you with questions and gives few answers, which only generate more questions and keep the tension high. Who is your mysterious benefactor? What is the Absolute? Why haven\'t you turned into a Mind Flayer yet? This early phase of the game was easily my favourite. I was trying to understand what was happening and explore the world around me. A world which is filled with side-content that is still compelling enough to explore even as I struggled with the main plot\'s great questions. Then I finally got my answers... and I was underwhelmed.Arguably, the game\'s greatest flaw is that it doesn\'t feel like it delivers on its promise story-wise. It sets the expectations sky high and maintains those expectations almost till the end. But I found the final act of the game and the resolution to the story rather lacklustre. Whereas early on, you are given the option to be good or evil, support different factions and see different results, by the game\'s final act the plot is more or less railroading you towards the same end. Your earlier choices don\'t matter all that much and in fact it becomes rather clear that the good path is definitely better developed. The conclusion to the story, as well as the reveal of your benefactor\'s identity left me incredulous and I felt that the whole Mind Flayer brouhaha, including the process of turning into one, was explained in a haphazard way that simply muddled the world\'s lore. It is a bit of a shame because the final act is easily the one with the most throwbacks to the older games as it takes place in the city of Baldur\'s Gate itself. The characters that can join the player\'s party are comprised of the available origins that weren\'t picked, as well as a few extras that come later on in the story. Luckily they are for the most part interesting and compelling to interact with and learn more about. When following the player they will also interact with the world and flesh out the experience, they will give quests, have wants and preferences. It is unfortunate you can only have 3 companions with you at a time, as it means that much of the content of the others will be missed. I would have much preferred if all companions followed the player and interacted with the world, even if only 3 fought with them in combat. It would be no less arbitrary a restriction. A pet peeve worth mentioning here is their romantic aspect. The companions are way too horny and eager to hit on the player, irrespectively of sex. Here you are spending a tender moment with one of your male companions and all of a sudden you are gay. Deny them and you are the bad guy. It\'s like non-romantic friendship does not exist in this world. Sigh. Gameplay wise the game is, again, at the top of its game. There is a lot that the player can do and a lot of ways to do them. The game often feels like a sandbox that invites the player to think out of the box and attempt solutions that don\'t follow typical game logic. I will admit much of this is not really very D&D-like. The game feels and plays a lot more like an Original Sin sequel, its fondness of elemental terrain included, just with a coat of D&D paint on it. The tweaks in the rules do work generally in its favour here, though I did get the feeling that Original Sin 2 could handle this kind of gameplay better than Baldur\'s Gate 3 anyway and I\'m not without my pet peeves. For example only being able to cast speak with the dead once per corpse and having your opportunity to speak taken away from you if you forgot to disguise yourself first, unless you reload that is, or Larian\'s bizarre inability to understand the value of heavy armour. Nitpicking aside though, the game is a blast to play, absolutely enjoyable, as well as fairly deep and rich in options. So, is this the best cRPG ever made or what? Well no, it\'s not. It\'s not even the best Baldur\'s Gate tribute of recent years, that is Pathfinder Kingmaker. Unsurprisingly, this felt more like Original Sin 3 rather than Baldur\'s Gate 3. Of course Original Sin is a great series, so that\'s not necessarily bad, but its focus and playstyle does differ. As such, this merger feels somewhat less focused. I also found the resolution to the story rather disappointing. Not bad per se, just unsatisfactory, it left me wanting. It\'s a good thing Larian is still tweaking the finale adding extras in recent patches, maybe we\'ll get there in the end. Be that as it may, this is still an impressively well made game that deserves to be played and then played some more. I absolutely recommend it to all fans of cRPGs out there.',''),(1271,'I know my opinion is VERY unpopular, but I\'m honestly struggling big time to get into this game.  20+ hours in and I still find it somewhat boring.

From the hair do\'s of characters and npcs to tile patterns on a dungeon floor, and to unbelievably masterful voice acting.The mechanics of DnD are well implemented and the rule system functions without a hitch.However... a let\'s start with a big one, the game is a step back from the late 90\'s crpgs. The story is stale, character development is mediocre, some things that all the voice acting and modelling in the world cannot fix. It is cringey to interact with most on an extended basis. The main story is nothing remarkable. You start at a huge high, abducted in a mindflayer ship attacked by dragons and survive the crash, and then climb your way back up to the excitement over a very... veeeeery long act 1.Game is devoid of memorable moments. There are Grandiose moments, but in the scale of things, they are not emotion eliciting. There is a barbarian with an engine for a heart, who is the sole character that shows \"Emotion\" which is \"Rage\", and that is the highlight so far. There are no moral quandries, no real choice between evil and good, or not even \"gray\" options.The bug in your brain thing is constantly used to create a sense of urgency, yet, it isn\'t? Twist of the century. And somehow it gives you powers, that you can upgrade? The only way to actually start using them is to trust a \"guardian\" character that you picked at the start of character creation, and only shows up in weird moments as a deus ex machina? And how does that play into the game? The scenario is a mess. It throws the player from wall to wall, and leaves you wondering \"what? why?\" in a bad way.Secondly, I think, DnD 5th edition is a shadow of its glorious 2, and 3.5 days. The ruleset is a mess unto its own, the barbarian being as sophisticated as a wizard in the name of \"balancing\" and equal power to players. With a party of 4 you end up spending \"considerable time\" trying to figure the optimal setup, character feats, sub character classes, various miscellaneous magics, calculate meticulously number of rages, attacks, damages, bah. I am not a munchkin, but the amount of work you need to do is \"boring\" just to swing an axe.Stealth in the game is dodgy at best. I have played games with better stealth implementation some from Larian itself. The new skill and ability check methods are going to make you \"SAVE-LOAD\" cheat quite a bit. They tried to mitigate that with \"inspirations\" but that wears out quickly. You end initiating dialogue with the wrong character, you pick an item with the wrong character, you walk around with the wrong character....load, load, load...There is also no indication of \"what was missed\" It may be a crucial button, or something trivial. Story should tell that. At least if something important is missed, induct suspense.And back to the story again, in a good game you should rarely if at all go to wikis to \"solve it\". With BG3 and its obscure methods you spend equal time reading wikis and guides as you do playing the game. There is no hand holding of course, but also, I mean, that\'s the point of skill checks right? You have to \"nudge\" the player.Also... critical hits and misses... a disaster in both cases. Bland, boring, tasteless. Not even a flavor text.The inventory is where you will spend most of your game time. Managing it is horrible. Looting in game is horrendously clunky in terms of both GUI and how the loot is placed. There are 10000000 barrels and chests and individual items strewn around. You end up checking EVERY SINGLE ONE just so you don\'t miss anything. To buy anything good from the merchants you have to physically travel long distances with encumbering loot. You are literally role playing a donkey.There are many many many more issues I have with the game. I played it because I wanted it to be good. I could have not played it at all, but it feels like playing with barbies rather than GI Joes. The elbows and knees don\'t bend and everyone has a plastic Fing smile on their faces with weird hairdos.Larian, hire less graphic artists, and better story writers.',''),(1276,'2023 GOTY LET\'S GOOOOOOOO',''),(1277,'cannot have sex with Keanu Reeves :(',''),(1278,'Panam Palmer is hot I wish women were real.',''),(1279,'Steam says I only have 1/2 an hour, but that\'s because I modded the game right away, so Steam doesn\'t count my 130+ hours.

Second playthrough was with female V, this time with Phantom Liberty added and I chose to side with Reed (won\'t say anything more). After the credits rolled at the very end of the game, because of my choice leading to a certain alternate path, I was so deep in my feels that I had to close the game and reflect upon my own life.

This game can sneak up on you due to how immersive it truly is.

Also, I did not expect space flight dynamics like in star citizen or elite, but what we got is a mix of atmo/space that leaves very little evasive maneuvering options.

The combat is satisfying and while I wish the game had fully animated cutscenes, I\'m okay with the artistic choice they made. Especially since the game is fun to play. My only criticism of the game, is the puzzles can be a bit frustrating sometimes and required me to use Google or YouTube more than once to look for guides with the solution as it\'s not always obvious even after flying around for several minutes looking for clues.

It\'s very much set up to use controllers, and trying to bind my HOTAS setup has a few hiccups, but it definitely works.

While the sequel doesn\'t know what it wants to be. It\'s more \"open world\" but the gameplay is not complex enough for flying around in empty space to be interesting.

Still a worthy spiritual successor to the venerable Freelancer.',''),(1326,'It\'s not quite what I expected after playing Everspace 1, but I was pleasantly surprised. There is a well developed plot, it\'s no longer a roguelite like Everspace 1, it is an RPG with a strong story and lots of dynamic and relevant decisions impacting the game. Have to save that pilot but accidentally shoot them instead? There will be consequences for that accident which impact the quest/game, but never prevent you from progressing. This is a big plus for immersion and realism in my books. There is a relatively realistic economy, prices vary by regional demand, and by buying low in one region you can sell for a higher price in another region and generate income just by shipping cargo back and forth. This may not be for everyone but there is a certain sense of accomplishment that comes from learning and leveraging the various regional demands to your financial advantage, this game definitely provides that. It is not necessary to do this as part of the progression of the game / story as far as I can tell, it\'s just an added bonus for those who want to rake in the credits.Flying feels great. It\'s similar to No Mans Sky if you\'ve played that. The controls are a bit tedious (as with most flight simulator games) but once you\'re acclimated to them they are very fine-tuned and there are some interesting options available to you in the settings, like disabling inertia dampeners to give a more realistic space-physics experience. With dampeners on, your spacecraft will be more manageable, though still with some carry-over movement which lends the flying aspects of the game some great depth and realistic feel. I think of this game as a hidden gem in the space/flight genre, if you are debating giving it a try I would urge you to take the leap. This is a fantastic game for the price and one that I will probably start replaying as soon as I finish it.',''),(1327,'Better than the first in pretty much every way.

The quality of game play is top notch, controls are very responsive while the ships fly smooth and feel great to fly. This game is great with controller or KB&Mouse. If they can continue to expand on the game\'s replayability factor then EverSpace 2 could stand as one of the best in space combat.',''),(1329,'There is a lot to like in Everspace 2.If you are unfamiliar with the title, in short, the game is a single player story driven space looter-shooter.It is a beautiful game, well designed and very visually appealing, and while the story isn\'t going to win an Oscar the story is still well paced and decently written. The game loop is pretty strait forward: Explore, Fight, Upgrade, Repeat. With that said if you are a fan of extremely deep and complex space games like Elite Dangerous or Eve Online to name a few this game is going feel much more shallow in what it has to offer, but personally I feel like that is a good thing. I wish the game supported Co-op and there was a little more variance in the loot, but this is being a little knit picky.Also, the Developers are awesome, Rockfish Games is a small company based out of Germany and they are very passionate about their game and it shows in there many steamed Q&A\'s.',''),(1330,'Compared to the first one, this one is a lot better',''),(1331,'*Most important thing is the game is designed with consistent play in mind, you can play it for the story but all the upgrade systems and contracts/side missions make it hard to get a banger ship without spending time just cruising around and doing side hustle.

Instead, however, there are a lot more fun encounters and puzzles you can solve that turn the game into a \'5 min rollercoaster\' chain. It\'s fun to zone out and just vibe.Something I don\'t like is a POI travel system where instead of jump gates (though they\'re still here) you go to a different \'map\' and fly to next point and then you arrive and enter a new scene. It saves on resource and game scope, I get it, but I wish there was a bit of seemless-ness to the look as you have it in elite dangerous or no mans sky.

I\'ll get to all that stuff in a while. But how\'s the actual game?Game PlayJust in case someone doesn\'t know, here\'s the quick and dirty about the TW series. It\'s a turn based 4X game on the strategic map and a expansive RTS on the tactical battles. It\'s geared more towards combat (eXterminate) than the other 3Xs (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit) with those engaging RTS fights. If you really are new to the series this game has a pretty thorough tutorial as well. Bonus points for that.As someone who owns all 3 TW: Warhammer games, I\'m actually at a bit of a loss to find the differences between War 2 and 3. There are different factions available in Warhammer 3 and some quality of life improvements, a few new interesting mechanics and expanded settlement battles. The settlement battles were divisive on launch but I personally I think they\'re decent if a bit confusing. The improvements are minor but they do add up.The combat maps are decidedly better, with a few more obstacles, hills and the like to use to your advantage. The maps have come a long way since the wide-open Warhammer 1 maps. Graphics have been improved over the life of the series and the game is really a joy to look at. Of course, there are the new factions. I\'ve been playing Grand Cathay for the last 30 hours and they \"feel right\" to me. I like generally playing the good factions and tend to turtle a bit. Having a faction with some decent troops behind a huge wall is kind of up my alley. But I\'m looking forward to playing some of the other factions as well. That\'s the thing about this series, especially if you have the prior games and DLCs. As long as you don\'t get bored of the game play, there\'s always someone new to play.The main draw of either is in owning the previous entries. War 2 has the Mortal Empires mode, which combines the factions and maps of Warhammer 1 and Warhammer 2 (if you own both games on the same platform). Warhammer 3 has the Immortal Empires game mode, which has the combined maps and factions of all three games. It\'s massive, with about 180+ factions playing at the start. But if you don\'t own the prior games, you\'re going to be very, very frustrated when you open the game and find there are around 25 different factions to play and you have access to maybe 6 or 7 of them. More on the DLC later.The world-building/city-management hasn\'t changed much. You still build from a relatively small pool of buildings (level 5 for a capital, 3 for a settlement), grow your city to build better troops. Depending on your difficulty level you may find yourself swimming in money which means it\'s time to build more armies and fight some more.I\'ve already mentioned the RTS battles. They\'re really good here. The Warhammer universe, with its magic and very diverse unit types, really suits this engine. In some prior TW games the combat felt \"samey\" very quickly as you fought essentially the same units with different skins over and over again, Not so here. Each race feels very different and I find myself trying to understand my opponents more in this game. What do they have? Magic? Flying Units? Poison? Mega artillery? How do I overcome that? Of course, there\'s always the auto-resolve for when you get tired of combat.Bugs, DLC, Creative ASSembly and Community UproarIt wouldn\'t be a fair review if I didn\'t mention why this game has Mixed ratings. (1) By all accounts it released in a pretty bad state - buggy, slow, etc. I didn\'t get into this until the 4.1 patch and in 30 hours I\'ve hit only 1 bug that caused me to have to drop to the desktop. There may be some other bugs and issues with factions but I\'m not in the weeds enough to know what those are. There are still some lengthy loading times for combat maps (30 seconds to 1 minute) as well. So while it was buggy, it\'s not really that way any longer. Still, you only have one chance to make a first impression and War 3\'s wasn\'t great for many folks.(2) The DLC policies are exploitative. First of all, if you don\'t own TW:War 1 and 2, you\'re going to HATE loading this game up because most of the Immortal Empires races will be locked. If you\'re still enjoying Warhammer 2 and you are looking to expand your experience, you would do well to purchase the first game right now instead of the third. It\'s cheaper, has just as much new content, and will enable you to play Mortal Empires which is an incredible campaign. You\'ll get to explore The Old World from Warhammer 1, which then borders the location of Warhammer 3. So you\'ll be able to orient yourself better if you go on to complete the trilogy at some point on the future. (3) Then there are the DLC prices. $25 for the Chaos Dwarves? That\'s insane. They raised the prices of their DLC and now are offering less content for each. Yes, the DLC is optional but it\'s still just...wrong, especially for loyal fans who own the first 2 games and much of that DLC. Shame.(4) Then there\'s Creative (Ass)embly\'s attitude towards their community.  There\'s really no excuse for their widespread forum bans or telling people the right to leave a negative comment on the forums is a \"privilege\". They\'ve also gone to war with some of their best YouTube channels like Legend of TW. Frankly,  CA needs a rectal-cranial extraction. The community has every right to be upset and CA needs to do better.ConclusionWhen it comes right down to it, I\'m enjoying the game. The game play, races, Immortal Empires campaign....it\'s a pretty great experience. So yeah, I\'m going to recommend it with the caveats I mentioned above. (1) If you have 1 & 2 and enjoy the game play then 3 is pretty much a must-buy. (2) If you don\'t have 1 & 2 and want to try one of these titles with a good tutorial, this is also a great choice so long as you understand the DLC spam. (3) But if you have that FOMO and you\'re going to get upset about not having access to 80% of the races in Immortal Empires, stay clear.

The variety in your builds is also so different, each item has 2 inscryptions (basically modifiers that you get for having a certain number of items with that inscryption) and you can basically make an entire build out of each one, that along with the massive number of skulls in the game make even runs where you are going after the same build (aka a physical run or a magic run) feel unique and special.',''),(1362,'skelington',''),(1363,'I love the art, I thought the story was actually pretty cool when I got a good streak going from beating the game on normal, then going from Mirror 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 in a couple of hours.Then I got to the dark hero phase 2 on mirror 3, died around 40%, and I can\'t seem to get much traction going again.Now, I\'m basically save scumming to learn the encounters(quit when you trigger Reassembly and try again), because I don\'t want to spend 40+ minutes getting to a boss to practice it. This is especially pertinent with the buffed adventurer encounter in act 4. If you\'re not already an expert at the game and you don\'t do well enough in an encounter, your run is basically over, so might as well just restart the adventurer encounter/map/boss if you didn\'t do it well enough. Making it out of an encounter with around 40HP is basically a death sentence, since you have to play extremely well to recover, and if you\'re extremely good, you probably aren\'t beating encounters with 40HP left.If you\'re not already amazing at the game, you need to figure out how to make a broken build, which is RNG and youtube videos, basically. I was watching a dark mirror 3 run for tips, and essentially the winning strategy was to get a couple early legendary items, luck out with the slime king to clone a legendary, and then the runner STILL commented on the first hero encounter that he ended up dying around 15% and so had to try again. Amazing. If you\'re not playing as cheaply as the game is, that would have been 1hr+ just flushed down the toilet, because good luck building the exact same load-out to try again.I don\'t think there\'s an item catalog/explanation in the game, but that would be handy, to try things without beating my head against the wall or losing 40+ minutes of run time. When your build is bad, you\'re basically locked into it if you have all your items/synergies/dark abilities and you\'re in act 3 or 4.I liked rookie mode to fill out the initial skill tree, and to learn the \"normal\" encounters. Honestly if you could turn it on in the Dark Mirror, I could see myself actually trying to play the game without restarting maps constantly, which gets un-fun pretty quick.In conclusion, if you\'re wanting to play this game to have fun, and see all it has to offer, look elsewhere.

I got it during the last black friday/cybe monday sale for 8 bucks or so. And after looking into other peoples reviews i kept hearing the same thing, \"the community is the best part\" and i 100% agree. The community is very kind to new comers, it isnt toxic, it isnt filled with griefers. Just nice people wanting to share the loot and help ease you into the game. But after that the game falls apart.As of right now over 5 years since launch the game is still glitchy and buggy. Although im sure its better since release it isnt at a acceptable state, especially for a company the size of Bethesda. For me personally at around 65 hours or so ive encountered tons of issues such as:Not launching or being able to sign in nearly every time the first timeMajor to minor visual bugs, such as \"ghosting\" where ill see the outlines of trees or building clippingHaving my character get stuck in the gun aiming animation, unable to heal, use vats, bring up the pipboy, or reloadClipping and falling through the world occasionally when using the cannibal perkGetting stuck in doors or other movable objects in the worldAnd encountering an insanely broke main story quest where im forced to fast travel away and back over and over and over again to try and fix broke npc path finding. So youd think after 5 YEARS they would have fixed these things right? Major issues that heavily impact players during the most basic day to day issues or even a major quest in the main story. Cyberpunk fixed itself, no mans sky fixed itself but not fallout 76. Other then glitches and bugs, the game is basic MMO stuff. Grinding materials, overly long quests sending you back and forth a hundred times, Basic ten minutes enemy waves as events, cosmetic grind etc. If your into that stuff youll more then likley have a good time but im finally hitting the wall and finally getting fed up with the game.I think if the best thing people can say about a game is that \"Its fun with Friends!\" or \" The game has a great community!\" then you as a company have failed. ANY game is fun with friends no matter how boring or bugged or simple it is. Having your community have to help and pander to newbies to keep them coming back isnt a good thing, but bethesda doesnt care. If they did they wouldnt have left the game in the state that it is right now. They wouldnt be going to reviews telling people they are wrong and showing how insecure they are about the garbage they put out. They would have made it up to their fans not gave them the middle finger and refused to give refunds, or leak personal information, or give a few bucks worth of in game currency to collector editon buyers, or put out such a ♥♥♥♥ game for a cash grab. DO NOT BUY FOR FULL PRICE, go to a discount website like G 2 A or wait for a sale.',''),(1379,'This game is still broken, can\'t even keep a resolution change without you having to create a custom .ini file and after \"fixing\" the resolution issue the game just refuses to load beyond the login creen and freezes, was excited to play this since it\'s basically fallout online but damn.',''),(1380,'Another game ruined by multiplayer. All we wanted was team co-op and you chained us down with lag instead.',''),(1381,'I know I will get hate for this review, but this is what i have to say about F76.I get it this is an \"MMO\" even though it feels more like just multiplayer anyway, what is great that you are able to SELL your stuff to other players who visit your set up shop, however while you are allowed to sell whatever you gather, but your space is so limited that practically I am always struggling with it. Okay so there is partial \"solution\" for it. Why partial? Because you get unlimited space for JUNK items only and that costs money. Are you kidding me? Why would i waste my money for partial solution when this should be in game by default without costing money. And top of that developers do not want to expand default inventory/stash space which at the moment is 1,200 KG, seems a lot? Not really, it will be filled within couple hours because Junk takes most of space and if you want to save weapons it will be full sooner. You would think that entering Power Armour could ease your inventory struggle? Nah, for some stupid reason whatever you are wearing (modified gear that expands your inventory) before entering power armour, your character\'s inventory has about 250 space for example and after entering power armour then you will lose all those buffs. Really? Like your character is undressing everything before using power armour? That was not a thing even in Fallout 4. So wearing power armour reduces your inventory even more, because P.A disables modified armour buffs. Either I walk around and get into combat with just my modified regular gear that gives additional inventory space and die within 3 seconds or i enter power armour and lose all additional space and walk around slow as molasses and survive for 10 seconds.I like to gather and collect stuff across the game even weapons which i would like to sell to other players but this mechanic is Just plain horrible.Microtransactions, really? You already sell game for 40 euros by default and you keep adding new cosmetic $hite to the game for what reason? Only thing you can interact from cosmetics you sell in game shop are chairs and couches the rest is garbo.Either double the size of stash or make special subscription for unlimited junk only that sells for 2.99 a month and we have a deal.I stopped playing F76 around March, 2023 and now only recently re-downloaded it at the end of November, 2023 and I can\'t just can\'t play it this way. I lose interest as soon as i load in into server.Inventory management is killing me.',''),(1382,'If I could pick a \'so-so\' option I would.Unlike a lot of people I came into 76 looking for a buddy-multiplayer experience, rather than either a solo experience or an MMO experience. Like most things you do with your friends, it was pretty fun for a while. The setting is interesting enough and there are a handful of standout areas and quests that were genuinely interesting and surprising. The progression system is interesting enough to hold interest and the capture-point minigame is neat. However, at the bottom of 76 there is something oddly hollow that I would argue is actually present in Bethesda\'s solo Fallout games (3 and 4 respectively) but is cranked up to 11. First a comment on the multiplayer experience: the game is oddly hostile to premade groups. The gameplay loop assumes you go back to base regularly which, with three or four regulars, is tedious. Also some dungeons and quest givers simply don\'t let you have everyone in the zone at the same time, so you have to break up the group to each do something solo before meeting back up again. This is part of the compromise with having choices in the game or with having content that is meant to appeal to soloplay but completely takes you out of a fun romp with your friends so three people can each have identical, separate experiences for some reason. Okay so onto the hollowness. Bethesda open world games thrive by giving you the impression that there is something new to find just over the next horizon. 76 is certainly big enough to accomplish this, and for the first 20-50 levels or so it does this fine, and frankly, the first 20-50 levels is enough content for some people and if it is, this game is fine. However, after that point, you start to see through the game systems. What\'s on the next horizon is another near identical boss fight, a group event that requires almost no input from you, another achievement based task that might net you a new hat or something; in other words, you learn there is nothing new to discover, just more tasks you\'ve already done before or environments you\'ve already seen. Combined with the fact that, by it\'s nature, the game requires you to consistently revisit old areas or do some things repeatedly, and the illusion that there\'s a world with things to do and discover peels away, revealing the MMO side of the game.The MMO side of the game is... fine, if a bit easy. It\'s similar to most other late-stage mmos where you grind the same tasks repeatedly for marginal gains. If you\'re hoping the endgame is PvP, you\'ll be disappointed. This game isn\'t awful, it\'s fine, and it\'s really where Bethesda\'s Fallouts were heading all along.',''),(1383,'Boring unskippable dialogs and having no relatable questline from begining, make this game too boring to bother.',''),(1384,'They sell bundles and individual items on the store that you will suddenly lose access to and no signs of a patch to fix the issue, no refunds for the effectively stolen money, etc. Still riddled to death with bugs',''),(1385,'100% recommend this game to ppl who loved game design of modern tomb raider trilogy..This game is Wiedzmin3 and Tomb raider mashed together in a mixer with a lot of downgrades in gameplay no smooth movement and aim feels like sponge instead of normal mouse.(if you play this game you know what i mean).The story is decent in the main parts.. sometimes animations are out of sync with sound, sometimes sound doesnt even load.. But this issue is mainly in side missions and random quests. In main missions it happens rarely.The world and npcs feels as flat as airport runway because you can bump into them, slice them and they wont even notice your presence.. some does with one sentence ussualy containing one word .. they wont even move or anything when they get to contact with you.. basicaly like a randomly moving pillars.This is amplified when you get to market in Meridan which sounds like there is a lot of npcs yelling at each other or doing some trades but in fact there are only few npcs there hardly any moving mouth like talking.. A lot of the positives goes into technical side of the game.. Like how well devs managed to hide all loading screens.. Sometimes even too well that if you manage to go into certain location without poping the loading animation the game either gets corrupted or start to slowly load all the assets soo it will drasticaly decrease your fps.. Both happened to me several times during exploration.On negative side of things: Hidden damage scaling with your character level.. I saw this when i slowly progressed trough game. On start i was trying to do stealth kills because they were highly efficient but on lvl 55 I found myself just oneshotting most of the low health robots like scrappers,watchers etc. with my spear(without dlc you cant have modifications on it soo i didn\'t put it on until i started playing dlc)Also what trows me off a lot was many instances of console movement where i couldn\'t shoot until i stand still or vice versa.. Happened in some \'\'Dungeons\'\' also you can\'t do more than 2 things at the same time.. Like you can\'t run, drink potions and have focus activated.Mounts in this game are basicaly obsolete thing you shouldn\'t use unless you want to make your life miserable. They can\'t jump unless the game decide its good time to jump, they can\'t jump down from things because it\'s too steep for them even if its just 20cm fall and unless you go by predeterminated road your mount will run slower than it should.Same thingy goes for parkour/swimming in this game.. You can do cool stuff with parkour or just swim really fast but only if you go where the devs want you to go. Otherwise Aloy refuse to get up from water even tho she is basicaly swimming in a 20cm pot. same goes to parkour.. she can jump from wall to wall even 4meters away but when it comes to basic stones you are lucky to not die and you need to spam spacebar to even make her jump somewhere.. Also if you go too high in mountain which you technicaly can the game will automaticaly kill you and respawn you on last saved spot.But hey it still have a decent story soo try this game when it gets discounted.',''),(1386,'Highly recommend this one. I grabbed it for $12 on a sale and it was so worth it. The stories are great. The atmosphere and immersion factor is great. The visuals are great. The NPC animations while they are speaking to you - are not great - at all. I turned the music down to 60% but maybe that\'s just my speakers. NPC\'s will sometimes talk over each other and cause you to miss some dialog. Or you\'ll be in a town talking to someone and a music band will appear beside you and start playing. Subtitles help with that.Zero Dawn is a unique experience, but I think it is similar in some ways to Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey (without oceans and boats). If you liked Odyssey but felt it was too big, then you will appreciate Zero Dawn which is still rather large and diverse but doesn\'t feel overwhelming.Non-Spoiler Warning: You\'ll get a Power Cell at the beginning of the game and you\'re told to find more. Most of them are locked to story progression and you will not be able to find them all until almost the end of the game.This game runs very well on the old LED Steam Deck docked to a 1080p TV using an xbox wireless controller, with most of the settings on High.',''),(1387,'I liked it.This game kinda splits itself into two uneven parts for me.

It\'s all perfectly functional - this is one of the better ubisoft-ish open worlds out there. It\'s just a tad uninspired. The better part is the apocalypse event in this post-apocalypse game. There are big parts about what lead up to this world, and I was 100% into it. It was just deliciously bleak and hopeless and brutal and I loved it beginnig to end. Kinda wished the present parts were more about that and less about the Mary-sue adventures with her harem of hunky boys.Oh well.',''),(1388,'Beautiful game!',''),(1389,'Great game, but the port does have it\'s flawsI\'m one of the nerds that wasted a lot of time playing (and getting a platinum trophy) on the PS4 version of this game, and absolutely loving the game. By far one of the best RPG titles out there! There are definite cons and pros like any game, but the cons are more about the core of what makes RPG games the way they are, and why i play very few of them.Pros:-Very captivating story which does a pretty solid job fleshing out and keeps interesting throughout the game.-Combat is pretty well balanced though your addiction to dodging will be the key to surviving at least 75% of battles.-Aesthetically, a masterpiece of a game, though it being the first huge title for a company like Guerrilla since the Killzone series (which I never was as invested in and never were as big as the Horizon series has been.) and the first in the series it definitely feels a bit lackluster/disjointed in the talking sections as the characters sometimes have unnatural movement (NPC classic moments) or the lip movement doesn\'t match the tone/volume of some of the lines they say. Not uncommon for the first in a series to have those issues. Those things aside the beauty of the game is incredible and it feels huge and exciting once you get going (mostly after you leave the Embrace).-Big array of weapons, equipment, outfits, machines ect. It left me feeling like there was always something to do and much to explore. At times it was overwhelming, but as you get more familiar and understand the curve of the difficulty as you play on everything tends to work out as what you primarily will fight with and wear during certain encounters.-Much to do and explore and it kept me coming back as most side quests were usually beneficial and relatively unique, but no game is immune from repetition ESPECIALLY in an RPG title lol.Cons: (there maybe some spoilers but i\'ll try and keep it as ambiguous as i can and censor most spoilers)-The endless running. it makes sense with such an open environment that you need to flesh out as much as possible and being a true RPG the game is going to be just massive, but if you\'re ok with sometimes just running 3 miles because you don\'t have any fast travel packs and you somehow missed that pack of striders running amok. It sometimes feels like a drag, but it\'s part of the game play.-This being a port it will have it\'s glitches from time to time, and i had a game breaking glitch initially where if i looted something too quickly it would either freeze momentarily or drop down to so slow for 20-30 seconds that it was less than a frame every 3 seconds. Then it would freeze to the point that it permanently ran at like 1/10th FPS which also slowed my PC to that speed until i restarted my whole laptop. I found a fix which resulted in me going to the properties tab in the game and turning off full screen optimizations which has fixed the issue, buuuut it was an issue i was having. Also some textures take a crap in certain cut-scenes which is jarring, and sometimes funny at times.-Slow progression at times. Just RPG stuff I\'m not always a fan of, but I will say some of the upgrades are worth the work to acquire.There\'s more i could elaborate on, but those are some of my pros and cons I have about this game. The cons are more about the issues of the port as those issues were never something i experienced with the PS4 version of the game.Should you buy this game at full price: I initially did for the PS4 and didn\'t regret it, but as for this version I\'d say wait for a sale as I did. There\'s just enough issues that SHOULDN\'T be issues, and mostly with it being a port it takes away from the high price take of $50 still.

The intriguing storyline, complete with unexpected plot twists, kept me hooked from start to finish.However, the game\'s attempt at promoting inclusivity felt forced, with a noticeable imbalance in character portrayal. It\'s disappointing to see most white males depicted as villains, alcoholics, or ex-war criminals. On the flip side, the positive portrayals of characters often come with unnecessary details like being gay or vegan, raising questions about the relevance of such specifics in the game.Despite these concerns, the game manages to deliver an enjoyable experience, blending elements from popular franchises. With some adjustments to its approach on inclusivity, it has the potential to be an even more captivating adventure.',''),(1397,'I vividly recall watching Horizon\'s debut through a streamer\'s eyes, initially drawn in by its stellar graphics and compelling storyline.

The variety—regular, tear, shock, frost, fire arrows—enhances strategic depth, making encounters truly immersive.Visually, Horizon hits a perfect score. The synchronization between mouth movements and voice acting is impeccable, complementing the stunning graphics that beautifully craft its art style.One facet of the storyline that left a lasting impression was Aloy\'s journey from societal rejection to becoming a beacon of hope. Her evolution from an outcast to a revered figure, saving countless lives from the looming machine threat, is a captivating narrative turn.Environments remain consistently refreshing, devoid of repetition. Each area brings new experiences, save for the familiar herbs, maintaining a diverse and captivating world.Immersed in the game\'s audio with headphones on, I found it both captivating and functional, aiding in tracking enemy movements and adding depth to encounters with satisfying combat sounds.The ability to override and stylishly dismantle machines stands as a unique and thrilling feature, further elevating the gameplay experience.While encountering a few minor bugs—like arrows passing through enemies and herbs stuck in rocks—these were hardly detracting factors from an otherwise flawless adventure.With the inclusion of a New Game+ feature, Horizon offers the opportunity to increase the challenge while retaining progress. This feature, combined with varied dialog options and reduced fast travel, adds substantial replay value.In summary, Horizon deserves a perfect score of 10/10. It comes highly recommended.

The disappearance of the dynasty in total obscurity means the end of the game. On paper, as you may have understood, the idea is quite simple to grasp. The issue, however, is that the franchise has never been a symbol of aesthetics and accessibility. The content is so colossal that it has left many in the dust, much like knights departing on a crusade and being defeated in the midst of a desert. Not to mention the interface, as austere as possible, which has driven away even the most determined players. Tackling this third installment, game designer Henrik Fåhraeus and his team knew they had to provide more significant contextual assistance and clearer guides. In this regard, Crusader Kings III takes a softer approach than its predecessor by offering a real tutorial this time, allowing even novices to grasp the basics and fully dive into managing their lineage.Crusader Kings III, a colossal medieval sandbox, has no equivalent. With incredible depth, the new gem from the Swedish developers at Paradox takes strategy and RPG to new heights. Aside from occasionally wayward artificial intelligence and a DLC policy that won\'t please everyone, this installment benefits from a remarkable interface, staggering content, and a much more pleasing visual approach than in the past. Each playthrough is a discovery, leading to decisions that are sometimes unexpected. For the first time, the series features a tutorial and numerous contextual guides, opening it up to a much broader audience. Without denying its origins, Crusader Kings III elevates the franchise to new heights and deserves my applause. Truly remarkable. Long review The tutorial is set in 1066, in the southern part of beautiful and sweet Ireland. Murchad of Brain, Duke of Munster, aspires to restore the reputation of a kingdom in decline. Between love affairs, family matters, diplomatic relations, treaties, betrayals, and plots, the burden of a throne never seemed so heavy. To establish and make his lineage prosper, the player must learn to weigh each decision, and that\'s precisely what the tutorial, with its explanatory guides, aims to convey. Crusader Kings III highlights an immense number of parameters that can be divided into several major segments. First, there is family management, taking into account love stories, marriages (arranged or not), the education of children, and the missions assigned to each of your relatives. Then, there is the diplomatic part and the relationships maintained with your people, allies, vassals, and neighboring or distant kingdoms. Added to this is the notion of fortification (buildings, men-at-arms, including the arrival of knights) and the formation of armies, essential for the conquest of territories. It is also impossible not to mention the significantly enhanced RPG aspect (thanks to a system of personality traits and a clever skill tree system inherited from the Way of Life expansion of Crusader Kings II) or the religion mechanic, derived from the Holy Fury add-on, which makes its return in an improved version. Each character has their own personality, opinions, and it is essential to surround yourself with loyal followers and advisors working towards the same goals. Finally, one must face a succession of random events (disease, etc.). It quickly becomes apparent that the longevity of the dynasty, which involves agonizing decisions, goes hand in hand with daily difficulties. Failing to keep an eye on power and its surroundings is a sure way to be annihilated. And this leads to difficult choices, such as getting rid of an intrusive advisor or even one of your children spreading false rumors and tarnishing your reputation. Thanks to tutorial, you can glimpse the richness of the game, but they are only a timid preview of what truly awaits you.Crusader Kings III offers a playing field that stretches from Europe to Africa and all the way to Asia. After selecting the desired era (9th or 11th century), all that remains is to choose the character to embody. Depending on the title of the said character (count, duke, king, emperor...), the beginnings will be more or less challenging. Paradox Interactive\'s creation is undeniably time-consuming and demands hours of governance to grasp all the ins and outs of a playthrough. Every event, whether familial or diplomatic, will have an impact on the ruler\'s stress gauge. Physical and personality traits must be considered to avoid situations that affect the ruler\'s mental state. For example, if the ruler is shy, it is preferable to avoid large crowds. Each playthrough is a discovery, and you must adapt to each of the individuals taking the throne (and those surrounding it). Some will be better at combat, others will be more strategic, while some will delegate excessively. What is exceptional is managing a playthrough for several hours only to find yourself in a ludicrous situation due to a misjudgment (an imprisonment, an assassination, a plot, a wounded soldier holding a grudge, a vassal you\'ve sent away...). In this title, nothing is predetermined; the foundations are there, but no one can anticipate the events to come. And that is undoubtedly the great strength of Crusader Kings III, even if, through experimentation, you will eventually discern certain AI routines.No more endless menus and the slightly cluttered appearance of the second game of the series! In contrast to its predecessor, Crusader Kings III aims to be much more pleasant, modern, and streamlined. The visual leap is considerable, thanks to a superb map, a completely revamped interface, and a myriad of contextual frames that seamlessly fit into the game\'s new approach. It\'s not uncommon to be confronted by an event that imposes a crucial choice, and there\'s no longer the feeling of being drowned in a cascade of menus with imperfect ergonomics. Crusader Kings III has been polished, refined, and meticulously thought out in every detail. The developers have managed to preserve the richness of the series while \'compacting\' everything into menus of great clarity. While some shortcuts would be welcome, it\'s evident that one no longer gets lost, and all information is accessible thanks to cleverly placed icons. In terms of interface, Paradox Interactive\'s title is simply a case study, and one can easily imagine the time it took for those involved to achieve this result. The introduction of 3D portraits is a welcome addition, with decent modeling and graphical details that will satisfy fans of the franchise. The musical aspect is also a success with good themes.Crusader Kings II held its throne for eight years. During these eight years, Paradox developers literally inundated the community with multiple DLCs, each addressing a specific theme (management of a different religions, map expansion, incarnation of a historical character, etc.). There is, therefore, a strong likelihood, especially after experiencing Crusader Kings III, that the same will be true for this installment. This DLC policy is sometimes felt during gameplay, as if certain elements were less integrated than others. While the novelties are numerous, it is nevertheless noticeable that certain aspects of the title are less developed than before (or downright absent). For example, the battles could have been more spectacular. I also think about the management of epidemics (Syphilis, Black Death...). It is evident that the game will gain content with expansions coming in the coming months and years. The studio, through Henrik Fåhraeus, has clarified that the add-ons will be less numerous than before and will be denser. For now, fans of wargames with a touch of RPG can rest assured: there is plenty to do with this splendid episode!',''),(1406,'☑ be a peasant☑ try to sleep with the king☑ get rejected by the king☑ start a peasant uprising☑ overthrow the king☑ become the new king☑ try to sleep with the peasants☑ get rejected☑ get overrthrown by a peasant uprising☑ repeat10/10',''),(1407,'Remember kids, in any other context, incest is wrong.',''),(1408,'I\'ve wasted so many hours of my life on this game',''),(1409,'The Vikings really fell off hard after they started introducing dwarfism into their genepool.',''),(1410,'Sims for menNever discuss anything you do on this game to outsiders without context.',''),(1411,'Please Paradox for the love of God do something about the stress system it\'s way to penalizing for such minor things not to mention some interactions that just don\'t make sense.

For example, alliances are not forged out of strategic need so much as it is about marrying off some of your relatives. To beat a stronger nation, there\'s no tactic to employ other than paying for mercenaries to add up to your army. Sieges are too cheap, the attacker only has to bid his time, the defenders have no say. For example, there\'s no sally option and the attacker doesn\'t run out of provisions.As for the rest, it\'s familiar with other Paradox games.

You could learn a lot new things. Cons:- Some of the DLC offered for this game should be free updates in my opinion as they don\'t really elevate the game play (ie. offer wardrobe pieces or additional situations you can click through). However, Tour and Tournaments and Royal Court are absolutely worth getting, with drastic game play changes that improve the base game.- In-game tutorials are helpful but even with that, the learning curve can feel pretty steep and overwhelming.

Requiring PVP in a game with so much rich PVE content was almost worse for me than just releasing a completely awful game. The wasted potential for a PVE mode or a split progression system was incredibly frustrating and ultimately led to me abandoning the game. There are plenty of games with PVE modes and PVP modes that work, do well and please both sides, but they devs continued to try and force PVP only down our throats. This was a few years ago and at the time, the devs said they weren\'t looking at a PVE mode and that it was against the spirit of the game.Fast forward to this week and Safer Seas, their version of a PVE mode was added to the game. I\'m so glad the devs learned from their mistakes, because this game is incredible now that the PVP mode is disabled. Safer Seas certainly isn\'t perfect. It needs more features, like higher progression levels for factions, etc. I just want to experience all the content the game has to offer without the toxic PVP aspect. I don\'t even really care about the 30% rewards, the fact that I can\'t fully level up the factions or participate in events that don\'t require PVP is more of a bummer for me. There are also features like captaincy that were taken out of safer seas that have no business being taken out. But the fact that the devs listened to the playerbase at all and added a PVE mode is such a positive sign to me that I actually have hope for this game to get even better, which I couldn\'t say a few years ago. So here\'s to hoping that the devs continue to learn, grow and provide a fantastic experience for those who want PVE, PVP or both!',''),(1428,'Sea of Thieves is a game that could be for everyone. Instead, it’s so obsessed with catering to hardcore PvPers that it forgets to make the game fun for anyone else. Even though PvE content is a massive portion of the game, the devs will actively punish anyone who tries to engage with it, leaving them to lose hours of work to a rival crew or to miss out on the vast majority of rewards and content.Good news! After waiting the better part of a decade, players can choose to sail the seas alone without the aforementioned threat of losing work. It’s called Safer Seas, and it’s definitely a step in the right direction.Bad news! All rewards you get from this mode are 30% of what they are on PvP servers, making an already grindy game even grindier. Most of the best money making methods are also locked, so really it’s more like 15-20% of what you would get otherwise.(Yeah, we know rewards are cosmetic, but unlocking these rewards is still what keeps many of us playing. When a PKer can make more progress in one hour than you can in five, it leaves a sour taste.)There’s also a level cap in Safer Seas, and most of the really interesting features are removed - even those like captaincy which have nothing to do with combat. If you’re a solo player like me, the main game is even worse. You have basically no chance of winning a fight with a group unless you sink hundreds of hours into learning the game’s mechanics. I know, I know, “find a group, it’ll make the game easier” - but what if I don’t want to play in a group? What if I want to go through at my own pace? If Rare cater for hardcore PKers, they should at least throw a bone to people like me. I don’t have the time or inclination to “get good”, and if there was a viable PvE mode, I’d probably sink hundreds of hours into it. Rare could triple the rewards for Safer Seas, and it’d still be behind the main mode in terms of earning potential. Only this time, there’d be a lot more people playing it. A vocal minority of the fanbase champion the PvP-anywhere gameplay, which is fine. Unlike Rare, I’m not here to tell you how to have fun. But any glance at a Safer Seas discussion will show there are a ton of people who play the game to chill out, complete quests and battle skeletons. It’s immensely frustrating to see Rare throw away such a golden opportunity to appeal to a wider audience. Hell, the whole reason I bought the game was because of the upcoming PvE mode.

This last one really took the cake, by nerfing DA sails along with a number of other sails, including ones people bought with real money. Why did they have to completely remove the cut-outs (3.5 years after the game\'s release), instead of allowing us to customise any sails with the cut-outs of our choosing? That would\'ve been a much better idea.Also, what\'s the point of safer seas if you don\'t have access to all events, like Forts of the Damned, for example?

Come today 12/23/2023 I decided to see if High Seas is worth playing still. The last 3 times i have played this game, each session being over 3 hours long upwards of 6, has resulted me in getting nothing at the end of each session because when you try to do anything that isn\'t pvp, you get followed till the end of time even though you have nothing yet, AND if you do get onto an island where your quest takes you, you will be camped for when you bring the treasure back then they kill you, take your stuff and thats it. Yes, PvP is part of the game, and there is a time and a place for it. However, it is harder for you to play a tall tale than it is to PvP. I do not mind as there are commendations for PvP which will have its time and place, however, Safer Seas should not have a reduction or a restriction to what you can or can not do. You already have limited it to earning a max rep of 40, but now you don\'t allow for collections of items to be earned when PvP doesn\'t have anything to do with it. My point is the game now, because the player base has dropped so much is only PvP players, those who just want to relax and not stress about whether or not all their efforts are for nothing, has no place in this game. Remove the limitations on Safer Seas, and those who want to achievement hunt or like to have all commendations WILL come back to PvP. High Seas has become a land for just PvP as its quite literally impossible to do any of the tales without being chased for an hour. If you want to complain about players staying in Safer Seas and removing the fun out of the game because you can\'t kill people who don\'t want to die then just go play Team Death Match in COD, some people actually wanna have fun and play with their friends.',''),(1442,'Here are my honest thoughts on the game!High Seas: With over 150hours invested into High Seas, I feel I am in a good position to give an honest and fair review of High Seas, so, here it is - High Seas players for the most part are PvE players looking to enjoy friendly PvP encounters but want to focus on PvE content with maximum rewards gained for their valuable time and effort, HOWEVER; if the comments in these forums are anything to go off, those that would have you believe that the PvP community are lovely people are full of themselves! The PvP community in this game is by far the worst I have ever come across, even worse than DayZ (and that\'s saying something), they will constantly shun you, and purposefully try to bully you into believing their opinion is the right one and that you are not to be believed nor trusted with your experiences because they themselves have never had a bad one or have good ones every play through. This is far from the truth, if you load into High Seas, you can be rest assured that within your first few hours of playing the game, you will have some sweat-lord roll up on you and do what they do best, get toxic, verbally abusive to the point of telling you to \"End yourself\" and sink you while throwing slurs, and abuse your way (God only help you if you\'re a female player because you are going to get called a lot worse and really have some disgusting things said to you!), this is if they don\'t chase you across half the map first or you don\'t manage to run away and scuttle before they get to you. High Seas to the devs and PvP lords is a perfect game, couldn\'t be fixed, and must be played to their pleasure, not yours! I have spent many hours playing High Seas, and it has only gotten more toxic since Safer Seas has come out! Noting once again in these forums there are a few select people who get confused with PvEvP and PvPvE (the concept is simple, PvEvP = Player Vs ENVIRONMENT Vs Player = while PvP is a concept and component in the game, the core focus is PvE and the game SHOULD theoretically be played as such with the game mechanics facilitating this, with PvP elements to your PvE gameplay - NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND as these people love to try to say this game is PvPvE - it is marketed, tagged and sold as a PvEvP) and unlike the very out of touch select group in these forums, having played my last HS session TODAY, I can tell you this entire statement is accurate having been minding my own business and rolled up on by a sweat lord, sworn at, called a coward, told to go \"End yourself\"(Edited because the 3 letter acronym is banned text) - \"GO PLAY SS IF YOU DON\'T WANT PVP LOSER!\" - this is the type of gameplay they will try to tell you doesn\'t exist or \"Rarely happens - you\'re just unlucky\" but the truth is, it happens more often than they will admit and if they say it doesn\'t - they\'re probably the ones instigating it, with their entire argument backed by \"Its called Sea Of Thieves\" or \"You got a PvPvE game - its what you paid for\" ( sad mentality), which these people seem to harbour so much saltiness towards the PvE player base for some unknown reason, but its very sad they are so driven to make the PvE player base leave by bullying them out or at the very least conform to their ideology - bringing me back to the whole PvEvP meaning and what the game is actually marketed as compared to how the game is actually played.Safer Seas: Oh let\'s talk about this game mode, it was wrongly advertised and wrongly marketed as a place where people who enjoy the aforementioned PvEvP can go to really enjoy their experience of Player Vs Environment and not be punished for it. However, we have seen a couple of moderators and players tell us this game mode serves as a \"tutorial for HS\", and if that is the case, should have been marketed as one in the first place before people spent REAL MONEY on a game to play a game mode that failed to deliver in its initial concept/ marketed purpose. Since this game mode has come out, these forums have EXPLODED with MANY MANY players expressing their sincere displeasure with this mode and how it has been delivered, attempting to give honest, constructive, and genuine feedback to the Moderation team and (as stated in a statement from Rare, this team works DIRECTLY WITH THEM) the devs in the hope that they would listen to this feedback and act in the best interest of their player base and not their own selfish desires, however, this has been the case where we have now seen the admin team forming a single-minded agenda based response system, copying and pasting responses, shutting down threads that tell them they are doing a bad job, and, (like myself) banning people who speak out more harshly against this type of despicable behaviour. The feedback given should of been welcomed but instead, we have been told that unlike every other game on the market, the devs WILL NOT ADAPT to their player base and will instead stick their heads in the sand and wish it all went away by censoring and silencing people who speak out against it! Let\'s get this out there, while this game mode might be enjoyed by a small handful of PvE players who like to play with their families or may have special access needs, this game mode is not enjoyed by the majority of PvE players, for its simple yet obvious attempt at giving the PvE community the middle finger by cutting profits/ rewards, taking away captained ships, blocking voyages and MORE! The attempts to silence people and delete their comments only go to show that anyone who does not agree with the dev\'s FAILED VISION of a PvP-only game will be silenced!Like many others, I have spent real-world money on this game and in the EPIC store buying skins, etc, helping to keep the community, the player base, and the game alive (Not to mention pay these devs/ mods bills). I am sincerely appalled at the moderators and the dev team for their actions in silencing people for having opposing views that may shine a light on their actions and calling them out for it. In an age where censorship is the only way to enforce your point - it is disturbing to see it happening here too. I have compiled and will continue to compile video evidence of the censorship taking place on these forums which may make a great video one day - who knows? ;).All I know is, IF you have read this far, and are considering buying this game, I would carefully think about your valuable REAL WORLD COIN, because if you do and are hoping the game will be a welcome place where you can act like a Pirate but have fun in the game - you may want to think again! The support structure in place both in these forums, and at Rare will not support any grievance you have - PvP tickets raised for toxic behaviour go unaddressed, and you had better not have an opposing view to that of the game devs or stand from under because you\'re in for hell if you do!IF the Devs truly cared about the game, and their \"Vision\" they would listen to their community and adapt accordingly, take Fortnite for example, it listens to its community and adapts to the times giving its players what they ask for, because of it, they make MILLIONS of dollars a week (Estimated 8Billion in 2023 from 6 Billion in 2022) and are one of the most successful games running for many years now. If the Devs want to look at successful game models, Fortnite is one, along with many others, and paying attention to what\'s working and what isn\'t FOR YOUR COMMUNITY is how you run a successful business/ game! It\'s really that simple!I know that I will cop a lot of abuse from these select group of players in these forums against this post, however, I have said what needed to be said and am not afraid to stick up for what\'s right and wrong!

Rockstar Games has outdone themselves in creating a world that feels as alive as it is stunning, and this title stands as a testament to the art of gaming.The first thing that strikes you about RDR2 is the sheer scale and attention to detail in its open world. From the sprawling plains to the snow-capped mountains, every inch of this landscape has been crafted with meticulous care. It\'s impossible not to get lost in the breathtaking vistas, the changing weather, and the dynamic ecosystems. Wildlife roams freely, and the world around you feels vibrant and alive.The story of Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, is a triumph of storytelling in the video game medium. It\'s a deep and emotionally resonant narrative that explores themes of loyalty, redemption, and the moral gray areas of a fading Wild West. The characters are richly developed, each with their own motivations, and their interactions with Arthur are layered and meaningful. The moral choices you make have genuine consequences, and the weight of those choices can be felt throughout the game.Gameplay in RDR2 is a seamless blend of action, exploration, and survival. Gunfights are intense and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and a dead-eye targeting system that makes you feel like a gunslinging outlaw. But it\'s not all about violence; hunting, fishing, and exploration provide a welcome change of pace. The attention to detail in mechanics, like maintaining your horse and managing your health, adds an extra layer of immersion.The world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is also teeming with activities and side quests. Whether you\'re robbing trains, solving mysteries, or helping strangers, there\'s always something to do. The game\'s open-ended approach to exploration lets you carve your own path through the world, ensuring that no two players will have the same experience.The visuals and audio in RDR2 are nothing short of exceptional. The level of realism in the character animations, the environmental effects, and the stunning sound design immerses you in this world like few other games can. The musical score is hauntingly beautiful, and the voice acting is top-notch, bringing the characters to life in a way that is truly captivating.In terms of longevity, Red Dead Redemption 2 offers an enormous amount of content, keeping players engaged for hundreds of hours. The multiplayer component, Red Dead Online, allows you to continue your adventures with friends, forming posses, going on heists, or just exploring the vast world together.To sum it up, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece of the highest order. It\'s a testament to what video games can achieve in terms of storytelling, world-building, and immersion.

In terms of details Red Dead Redemption 2 never fails to impress, as it offers a rich immersive world that\'s meant to be explored, aside from the main storyline itself. Rockstar Games really set a new standard in terms of open world games, with its intricate and mesmerizing world, thriving wilderness waiting to be tamed, different towns with each one having their own personality, so many NPCs with unique dialogues, side quests, random encounters, hunting, fishing, crafting, treasures, unique weapons/items and other secrets to be found.All these activities will often set you off a different path, making it easy to lose yourself and forget that this is a Western game after all.The storyline, while not perfect, is second only perhaps to character development. Despite having a slow start, the theme of the Wild West and the Outlaws\' last days manages to keep you intrigued.

The game is split between building your own outposts and raiding outposts made by others. Both are appealing for different reasons and can be rewarding but it is not mandatory to do both if you find yourself gravitating towards one over the other.RaidingRaiding sees you entering another player\'s outpost and trying to steal a key resource (referred to in-game as GenMat) while avoiding all of the traps and guards the opposing player has set up to kill you. Everything in this game operates on a one-hit-kill basis so raiding is based predominantly on quick reactions and carefully taking stock of your surroundings. Something that should be said is that while I quite enjoy the raiding, Meet Your Maker is not the game for you if you get easily frustrated when having to repeat a challenging level over and over. Many of the outposts available to raid are brutally difficult and you will be reminded constantly that the builder\'s goal is the kill you as many times as possible. If you find that kind of challenge rewarding, you\'ll have a very satisfying experience with this game. There\'s an undeniable joy to finally finishing a difficult outpost that\'s had you tensely moving around every corner desperately on edge because you\'ve made it further than you ever had before and don\'t want to lose your progress.The gameplay options available to you as a raider are simple yet efficient. You can only carry two weapons and a couple special items. These can range from guns to swords to grenades to shields. This is in addition to passive buffs you can apply to your character via either your suit abilities or single use enhancements. The game\'s received a few updates by this point and the options for equipment loadout now offer a decent variety of playstyles. The systems aren\'t overly complicated but that\'s because most outposts are designed to be completed in only a few minutes (provided that you don\'t die. In practice some of the harder outposts can taken considerably longer to finish as you go through multiple attempts)Something that is remarkably strong is the movement system for the raider. You can use a grappling hook (seemingly a necessity in all sci-fi FPS games now) and can move around an environment very fast, zipping around enemies and traps dodging dozens of projectiles as you try to clear a room. My one major criticism of the raiding experience is that while this type of movement is possible, it is only viable in specific circumstances. In most outposts, it\'s much more reliable to take it slow and only put yourself in least amount of danger at a time, which feels like a waste of the movement mechanics. Rushing in, especially when you don\'t know the trap layout will certainly get you killed. BuildingThe other half of the game is building outposts for other players to raid. While the raiding can be equal parts tense and chaotic, the building is obviously much more relaxed and almost meditative. The layout of each outpost is based on a 3D grid of blocks, looking very much like a high-res version of minecraft but also including 45 degree slopes. You can place blocks or create entire walls/floors at a time. Traps and guards can also be easily dotted around your environment. Everything has to be placed manually though. There is no way to copy entire sections and paste them or rotate them elsewhere. This can make certain features like repeated decorations or trap layouts a bit tedious, but the tradeoff is that that building system is very approachable. There\'s a very low learning curve to the technical side of building, although the more creative side both in terms of visuals as well as good trap placement and level design will take quite a bit of practice to become really proficient with.There are several limitations to the building system. The main one is that there needs to be a clear path from the entrance of the level to the GenMat for the raider to collect. This path needs to be navigable by the Harvester Unit (HRV) which cannot jump or climb walls. This means that the path must be continuous. This can feel a bit limiting, but it\'s vital for ensuring that the raider has some idea of where to go. If you could put the entrance to the GenMat down a hole or tucked away in a wall somewhere, the raiding experience would be defined more by boredom from trying to find out where he/she is supposed to go rather than by the challenge of contending with your traps. Another limitation is that the plot of land you can build on is auto-populated by immovable bedrock which shows up in random patterns for every outpost you create. Once the bedrock is generated it is impossible to remove it and you must build around it. I understand that this was done to force builders to use different layouts for each outpost they make, but sometimes the amount of bedrock generated can get frankly obnoxious.Something else I want to highlight though is the possibility for artistic expression. Having to build exclusively with cubes and 45 degree slopes may sound limiting, but Meet Your Maker provides a lot of cosmetic options for customizing your outpost. These are all entirely optional, but there\'s a lot of flexibility for some visually impressive maps as demonstrated by the community. Not every outpost you run into will have that kind of love put into it, but some of the ones that do really shine.ProgressionUp until very recently, this was something the game really struggled with. It\'s improved significantly with recent updates, but it\'s still in my opinion the game\'s weakest part. This mostly stems from how there isn\'t much to spend the different types of currency on. You\'ll find that unless you are building and activating/reactivating outposts a lot, you\'ll quickly find yourself with a buildup of currency. Something you can spend the money on are boosts that result in you getting slightly more money for a short duration (only an hour or so depending on your level) which seems baffling and like the kind of thing that would be done in a free-2-play game... except Meet Your Maker isn\'t free-2-playRecently though, there\'s been a collection of cosmetics you can unlock by raiding a lot. These help provide some more incentive to raid more outposts (which in turn gives the builders more rewards, as they earn progress for kills and accolades given to their outposts) but it doesn\'t solve the aforementioned currency issue. The cosmetics themselves are pretty good. Given the game\'s very serious tone they can\'t go into wild territory for suit/weapon skins like a more cartoony game could, but it\'s still a welcome addition.ConclusionMeet Your Maker is a game that tries and mostly succeeds at balancing both fast paced and tense first person combat with more relaxing and user friendly base building. The raiding can lend to frustration sometimes and the building takes a while to develop as a skill, but both offer a satisfying gameplay loop, even if the meta-game progression still needs to be ironed out a bit as the development progresses.',''),(1469,'i hadnt played it in a while. decided to check out the new sector 2. new layout was incredibly confusing for me, idk why i had to start at .5 star when i was comfortably playing at 3+ star before. crashed on my third run, had to restart my pc cause its horribly optimised',''),(1470,'Do you enjoy dungeon crawling in games like Skyrim?

Don\'t trust this game',''),(1481,'I see this is one of those games the community is trying to rally against even without playing it or looking into it in any depth, and so I\'ll spend some of my life writing my first steam review.I like hard games, I like Asian aesthetic and historical culture [as well as folklore], and I like uniqueness.  This game checks all those boxes well, and I\'ve seen the game grow in playability since it\'s early seasons; In fact, I don\'t think they even called them seasons at first.  It\'s not perfect, and my biggest gripe at first was that it was a game with an upfront cost as well as many micro-transaction options.  The game is now free to play, however, and you unlock legendary skins/items every now and again from just playing, as well as offering ways to unlock playable characters of your choice with in-game currency.When mentioning this game in conversation, I\'ve been met with disinterest because of it\'s lack of popularity as well as some off-hand racism.  I encourage all that are looking for a challenging and fun game to give it a try despite these stigmas.  I\'m very glad I tried it out that first time.Since this is an honest review, I\'ll mention cons as well.  I feel there\'s just a bit too much going on in the main menus as far as events, currencies, packages, skins, doo-dads, links, texts, ect.  I DO enjoy it to some extent, as it\'s a fun tribute to the Chinese culture to have festivals and events and cool little gifts; However, it\'s just a bit excessive of this function, to the point where I don\'t know what some things are because I simply want to get into a battle most of the time and not try to track down what kind of coins I just acquired randomly and what shop I can use them in.Gameplay-wise, I have a great time.  There are some very good players in this game, and it\'s very important to try to pick apart what exactly they\'re doing better than you and try to use those skills for yourself; Which is akin to martial arts, and I think that\'s cool.  A high-skill ceiling for sure, BUT those that are scared of this shouldn\'t fear TOO much.  There is a bot mode with 3 difficulties that you can play solo or with your friends so that there is no chance of being whipped up and down by the \'Lord of the Lobby\', as I\'ve affectionately named the player you can see in the lobby before you spawn in that has a mastery rank that you can\'t even understand.  Piggy-backing off that point, when you play PVP, there will be bots in the mix, and you will feel great for defeating many of them; But when you meet the \'Lord of the Lobby\' in that same game, your fate will likely be sealed before you realize it is he/she.  It makes you pay more attention, if anything; BUT the skill jump can be a bit of a shock when it happens.Might I add, you can accomplish the in game quests/achievements in the bot modes.Overall, this is one of my favorite games to play lately.  I\'m a bit of a casual gamer, as you can see I don\'t have thousands of hours in this game, only a hundred or so; But I still find it challenging and fun.  For fans of the Dynasty Warriors series, it will feel homey but also much more polished and fluid.  If I may interject with a comparison here, there are many, many Dynasty Warriors games, and they\'ve gathered quite a following over the years.  However, they have been much of the same game with improvements here and there on graphics, features, and playability.  This is a fresh take on a very similar concept of gameplay, polishing it up and also incorporating pvp and online co-op.  Dynasty Warriors holds a place in my heart from years and years ago, and I think looking at the two side by side grows my love of Naraka to and even higher state.I won\'t give a number rating for this game or any other game, that\'s not my style.  Just know I like this game a lot and I think more people should give it a try.  Thank you for reading my review, and may your journeys be full of wonder.',''),(1482,'This game feels nice but the countless times I get ganked by Chinese players into lagging hell really suck the life out of wanting to keep playing.

Although the loot boxes are only cosmetic so they have no barring on game play and it would seem that the money they make they actually reinvest into the game to constantly bring the player base new and interesting content.

But that\'s the problem, its basic and all the best parts of the game are locked away behind the most expensive set of DLC on the market.

The game matches you with other players that are level 10 or there about. Maybe a level down or above. With the idea that you will eventually play above that level to be paired with more skilled opponents as you yourself improve.Casino based matchmaking: You are level 10. You did very good and won the last game. So now next game, you will be paired with level 2s and 3s and you\'re up against a team of level 15s who are overdue for a win because they lost their last match.So why should it be called \"casino based\" matchmaking? Well, studies have shown that people who lose too much are more likely to stop playing sooner. Also, people who win too much are also likely to get bored and stop playing. This game, much like COD, in pure Los Vegas fashion, pre-determines the outcomes of your matches before they even start to artificially give you the impression that you\'re getting a spread of wins and losses. The same way a slot machine does. Because if your outcomes are inconsistent, the player might be compelled to play more, without getting tired of winning or sick of losing, so they stay around longer, making them more likely to spend money on it. To put it simply, it rigs your matches based on how well you do, by pairing you with players most likely to assist you in giving you a win or loss, and your metric of performance fulfills this role for them as well.Don\'t believe me? Well, let me ask you this: You ever notice that in the older Halo games and even the older COD games, after the match ends, you were able to stay in the lobby and play with the same people you played with last game? How come that doesn\'t seem to be the case anymore with this and other modern games? Check out Master Chief Collection and see what I mean. Still need more proof? Try this experiment: Play through 5 or 6 matches. Take screenshots of the scoreboard at the end of the game, then look for similarities in all your losses and all your wins. Look for the \"types\" of players you\'re matched with. How often is the player in last going 5-11? How often is the player in first going 16-5? How often are the two players in the middle close to each other in score? Can you see a pattern?In conclusion: the game is rigged and you\'re wasting your time playing. Why see a match through it\'s entire 10 minute course if your team composition has been curated to fulfill the match outcome assigned to you?

To preface, this game was gifted to me by a good friend who wanted to see if his nostalgia for this series would match the critique of someone who had never played any of the Halo games, Me. We played in the order that they were released, in co-op, on Heroic difficulty and while I enjoyed the multiplayer, I won\'t really mention it too much because I don\'t have much to say on it, it\'s fun, the devs took their sweet time adding stuff in, and hyper monetization sucks ass. In no particular order, here\'s a list of games that were at some point referred to as \"Halo Killers\"; Haze, Killzone, Pariah, Titanfall, Advent Rising, Halo 4, Halo 5, Halo Infinite. Many lived, many died, and God willing, one day they might allow old Master Chief to crawl into the grave he so richly deserves. Halo is the prime example of when a franchise is allowed to go on for far too long, without reinventing itself. It rested on its laurels for far too long. With Halo 4, 343 gave us an excellent story about Cortana\'s slow and moving decline, and a lot of nonsensical extended universe stuff. Halo 5 was a mess of poorly executed ideas in both the squad based combat, along with the failure to pass on the torch to a new main character, and the walking back of Cortana\'s demise.Halo Infinite, lacking any sort of confidence in itself and in the past games, hand waved the events of both Halo 4 and 5, dropping multiple plot threads or outright retconning them. The opening mimics the Halo 2 opening, putting the Infinity under siege by \"The Banished\", a legion of ex Covenant, so once again, we\'re fighting the same foes for the 6th or 7th game. The ship is destroyed by a blast after MC loses in a cutscene, he\'s found floating in space not long after by some random dude and they land on a broken ring to find it swarming with Banished, looking for the remnants of the UNSC Infinity crew. Here are the two things I liked about Halo Infinite. 1. The gun play, it\'s Halo, the gun play is great. 2. The grappling hook, one of the new gimmicks for this game, it\'s fantastic, as grappling hooks tends to be. Whereas Halo was once an innovator and marched to the beat of its own drum, these days it\'s comfortable just following in the tracks of the gaming landscape writ large. Tell me why one of the most prolific game series in the medium in taking notes from Ubisoft\'s open world design. The world map is scattered with nonsense activities for you to do for nothing other than \"Number go up\". Armors for multiplayer and skill upgrades are found throughout the world, so every other activity you do just gives you credits and vehicle unlocks, but the terrain is so jagged and vertical that some vehicle unlocks are objectively better than others. In what situation would you use a mongoose in this game? There\'s nothing to parse with, saving marines in the open world and in the base assaults has them follow you around but they don\'t have the same mobility that your grappling hook gives you so what\'s the point? It\'s not like every marine you help along the way appears at the final fort assault. You spend this game going through the motions, something that\'s apparent in the story as well. So, Infinity\'s gone, Cortana\'s dead for good I guess, you have \"The Weapon\" who\'s new Cortana, and Echo 216 who saved from space is a cowardly fanboy. The villains are your classic Halo affair, people who want to be known as the one\'s who finally put down the MC, they\'re just paper mache villains. The cast is so boring, no one has anything interesting to say ever, they\'re all just walking the same predictable path, Echo is a coward who eventually finds a little confidence, if not in himself, then in the Chief. The Weapon spends most of the game trying to fill the shoes of Cortana, while the MC acts abrasively to her for 10+ hours of content, only for them to reconcile barely in the final act. A new villain is introduced who Is apparently older than the forerunners and calls herself \"One of the Endless\", a race of aliens that predates everything I guess, so we\'re hitting all of the cliches with this one, she puts up a weak fight at the end and then frees her compatriots who then teleport themselves throughout time and space. The story ends on a weak cliff hanger, and they give a subtle nod that MC might have to travel though time to stop the villains. From a writing standpoint, time travel is one of the hardest things a story can do, it\'s difficult to pull off, and the ramifications of it tend to extend into sequels and into both the actual and figurative universe at large. I, for one, do not have the confidence that this company, with all of the shake ups and purges and questionable business practices, can pull it off. I believe the lowest point for Halo is yet to come, and I would love to be proven wrong. 3/10. Halo Skimfinite.',''),(1562,'With all of its updates I actually quite like this game now.

The art direction is the best it has ever been, progression is easy with the permanent battle passes, gameplay is simple but offers a lot of fun tactics and mobility options, and there is a decent amount of things to do especially with custom games and the Forge mode.I must admit that the multiplayer is very sweaty built around a competitive playing field and I am personally more of a social Halo player, though there are various playlists tailored towards more casual players so you won\'t feel left out entirely, and it did not stop me from continuing to enjoy the game. The campaign is also good fun, though you may find it empty if semi-open worlds are not your thing and I personally felt the variety in the environments was really lacking.',''),(1566,'gud',''),(1567,'I did enjoy Halo Infinite\'s campaign when it released in Dec 2021.

The campaign is lacking in story in my opinion, where the villains kind of just show up on holograms telling the Chief that he is annoying, but the gameplay once again keeps things fun. Level design can get repetitive, and there\'s really only 3 environments you play in. I wish that there were more of the multiplayer cosmetics that you can find around the campaign map, maybe like a few helmets or something, since I paid the full price for the campaign.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

It was long and fun 60+ hours, but after two month from release i cannot recomend this game, and heres why:1. Microtransactions and eggs. Some skins are available from shop for cookies, some for bucks. And some of them cost a-lot. One skin can cost more then game itself. One skin. ONE SKIN. And some skin, if im not mistaken, only available from eggs - lootboxes.I opened like more then 40 ( no money spend, only from in-game awards + buying some, for the bucks i got as reward ), and got a lot of duplicates ( like 3 or 4 from every 10 ) and 0 legendary skins.2. Region locked skins. The game have a lack of skins i think. Some characters only have a few. And some skins you can get from out-game reward, like twitch drops, discord nitro etc. And at least once, there was a variant of skin ( color ) only available through chinese site, maybe it was some kind of local twitch alternative, idk. I think thats a bad practice...3. Content update frequency. Recently, finally, devs give us some kind of roadmap. And said they plan to make a big updates - I didnt not understood what it will be, i mean a lot of content, like skins, maps, weapons etc, or just one thing from each category, like only one map, character, one collab skin, one weapon etc. If second variant - that would be bad. Cause frequency they promise is three month. From release we have a new map, for halloween, one new item and i think that it. For 2 month. And in-game shops, that updating big skins every week are in constant loop for now. Currently collab is Ori skins, and i think i saw it in shops like for 5 times already. Too repeative. 4. Map perfomance optimization. Some map are ok about that, no problems at all. But on some there a little bit of problem. And one is a big problem - Gator Valley. My GPU is going crazy here, very hot and loud like im playing CP2077 on Ultra, especially in sequences with waves coming. 5. Hit boxes and registration. From beginning i didnt have problem with that. But after recent updates, it feels like they broke something. Example: I was 1v1, opponent was with nunchucks. I waited for right moment and made jump kick with full stamina on him. And he fell on floor. But he didn\'t got knocked out. And he hit me with his nunchucks, and im died. And i saw moment like this as spectator quite a lot recently. Didnt happened before.6? Battlepass. Game have battlepass. With 100 levels, skins, egg coins, bucks etc. And good question. What will be next? With next season. New battlepass would be free? Or, counting that fact that this game have in-game purchases, you would need to buy it? Some more content would be behind the paid-wall, in a premium game.That leads me to a point, when after 60 hours, for 2 months, with small content updates, this game became boring. Same maps, no new skins, characters. And even fight system feels kinda broken now. I was hoping for this game to be better than that. Sad, cause i had some fun time with this game, but it looks like it\'s over.',''),(1647,'Chaotic & cute.',''),(1648,'This game is just simply bad.

I loved the game mechanics and the resource management of food, fuel, morale, crew, and loyalty.

The music was beautiful, the writing was surprising, and the art was gorgeous!! Choices definitely matter. Would highly recommend!',''),(1656,'This is a bit of a curates egg of a game. And I can\'t really recommend it. Its harsh and unrelenting but the story it tells is quite riveting at first. It reminded me of the excellent show \"The Terror\" - based loosely on true events when two vessels of the royal navy attempted to locate the northwest passage and got trapped in pack ice. This is essentially the same sort of story. As 1st mate you find yourself on the Temperance whose Capt is tasked with locating its sister ship that got lost looking for a \"south west passage\".All too soon the ship is trapped in pack ice, the Captain deserts with three members of its crew and you are picked to be the Captain. Its at this point the game truly begins. What it is in essence is a resource management/survival game in the harsh frozen south. Rescue is months away. The only option is somehow keep going, looking for game. Looking for fuel. Making hard choices that effect morale and the status of supplies. All held together by the story of your character and the remaining crew of the Temperance.It was going well until week 17 of the ordeal and became quite apparent that I was faced with total disaster and a possible restart. Possibly from way back earlier in the game. The problem is its quite unforgiving. Any miscalculation can spell total disaster for you somewhere down the line. Your problem is having to rewind the story and replay the last few turns, trying to figure out were you went wrong. Possibly having to consider a complete restart. It feels like having to re-read the last few chapters of a book again and again until it sinks in. Make to many of these choices and after a while this story feels like its overstayed its welcome and you honestly can\'t be arsed trying it again. I reached my 4th rewind and replay and lost interest. Maybe sometime down the line I might try it again, but for now there are other games to play.',''),(1657,'Just finished this game so I might have some recency bias, but I really liked this game!

The writing is 10/10! It takes a bit of trial and error to get used to managing everything which is fine, but I wish you weren\'t penalised so harshly (literally with death) for failing early on. Everyone died on my first playthrough because (MILD SPOILER) I didn\'t realise you had to move them off the ship within a certain amount of time. It\'s frustrating to start getting immersed in the story and characters, only to be abruptly met with the (unskippable) credits sequence. It doesn\'t hold as much weight to see everyone die when you barely know them, so I just wish death could be easier to avoid towards the start of the game. Nevertheless, I am really having fun with this game so far. If you\'d similarly like to focus more on story than on survival, play on the easiest difficulty.',''),(1661,'This game was so well done in so many ways that I genuinely want to leave a good review, but there was one issue with the writing towards the end of the game that just completely took me out of it. To be clear, the mechanics of the game were great, the atmosphere was great, and most of the writing was incredible. The art especially was really good. If that is what you\'re looking for, then absolutely buy the game and have a good time. it is GOOD game and everyone involved in making it deserves props. Stop reading here because of spoilers. So, SPOILER ALERT FOR CHAPTER 4.The dogs. The justification for the thing with the dogs felt so ham-fisted and forced that it came across a little more than trauma-porn, especially given how close to the end of the game it is. It seems like the writers were trying to advance the theme of suffering, difficult choices, and the fact that sometimes you \"can\'t win for trying\", and that\'s good storytelling for sure. But to have the set up for such a heavy thing be \"well dogs can\'t sail\", felt really poorly done, like it was an afterthought plot point spliced in after the story had already been written in order to pump up the sad. The exact same scene could have been written in, achieving the desired effect with devastating results, by moving it a little earlier in the game and making it a choice between feeding them to the crew or possibly letting people die of scurvy. It\'s just as hard-hitting without feeling as unjustified as \"dogs can\'t sail\". As it stands, it\'s a real \"Jack can\'t fit on the door\" moment in my eyes. Because of that I lost my buy-in to the story and ended up feeling really apathetic about finishing the story. I played on a little more and then decided to leave it there. There\'s a lot to love about the game, but in the end I can\'t recommend.',''),(1662,'A solid game with an interesting narrative, I got surprisingly attached to the characters, especially Hammond.

That by itself would be fine, but you don\'t get sufficient feedback for how you\'re doing (you might already have lost the game, but only realize after hours more play). And the Interface is tedious and cumbersome.The save tree mechanic would be a cool idea - it\'s a branching timeline where you can only ever replay fixed increments - but it doesn\'t work with a narrative game.

Remnant 2 does exactly what Remnant from the ashes did, but better. The Game looks absolutely amazing, the weapons are cool and fun to use and most of the Areas are fun as well. The Game however has some flaws. The first of them being N´Erud, ♥♥♥ N´Erud, this area is absolutely unfun.While the Idea and Lore of the area is pretty cool, the experience isn´t. Large open areas, locked by poisonous mist that animation locks you, as well as tons of Zombies and Drones shooting you. The Dungeons are either Hallways filled with bugs and other crawling creatures or Towers with the same Robot enemies all over the place. But hey, at least the bosses in this area are kinda cool. The Second Issue I have with this game are the FPS Drops. My Hardware exceeds the recommended stats, and yet the game sometimes freezes or drops down to below 20 fps. This Issue made the Endboss into a double fight. Fighting the boss itself, while fighting FPS Drops and input delays at the same time. Despite these Issues I´ve beaten the game three times and had mostly a good and fun time. Co-Op is also where this game really shines. Playing with friends can make this game a lot easier, or harder, depending on what your friends are doing. When not taken too serious, friendly fire can cause some hilarous moments, where Rotten Arrows or Firestorm knock you around or suck you out of the map, just to fall free bird style for 30 seconds.

In a perfect world, good taste would be a universal virtue and everyone would have already bought and enjoyed the masterpiece that Remnant 2 is.....but we all know this is not a perfect world.Let me tell you something about Remnant 2. We are talking about one of the most polished and amazing games ever made. Gunfire broke the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mold and this is no longer a \"souls\" with guns....this is Remnant 2 baby, and Remnant 2 now has its own game category. The unparalleled and  extremly satisfying third person shooting action is the main reason to buy this game right here and now but of course you...(the reader of this review) want more than that and belive me when i say you shall get it. Im not going to bore you with details and a wall of text but will just say that the game feels totally different depending your \"loadout\". As a loadout im not only talking about your archtypes or weapons....ooooh no hoho. Also ring, traits, amulets and more, game feels completly different and equally entertaining. So dont even dare to think this is a simple game at all but at the same time not unnecesary complex. You can face the challenge by yourself or with friends in true co-op action, reanimating your fallen comrades while you run towards them as fast your character legs allows it. All of this with massive bosses and monsters in the way, raising hell every second forcing you to constantly think your next move and avoiding harm. There are various difficulty levels designed for basic or more advanced characters but all of them provide a balanced and extremly challenging experience both solo and co-op. Now...graphics..this is ART. From the jungle of Yaesha to the derelict docks in Losonm everything looks perfect, after all we are talking about a Unreal 5 game well programed. So bear in mind that you will need a \"decent\" computer with a proper GPU and not trash like a 3070. Boss fights are breath taking...everything in this game is.Sound. I think the guys who picked the Game of the Year award nominess are totally tone-deaf in every sense of the word. Mr. Rob Westwood composed one of the best soundtracks ever made......i consider a CRIME this game was not nominated for this particular thing...but i guess there are some philistines left  (even in 2023)Anyways go and buy the damn game already. Treat yourself with the best action game of the year, alone or with friends you are going to enjoy every second of your time played, so dont miss it!Oh one last thing. There is people who consider hot garbage like Sekiro the hardest game ever made. They think they are some \"superstarts\" for beating a damn game about a one handed hobo with a katana (LOL)....you guys are nothing more than fluffers...KINGS who killed the last boss alone or co-op in  apocalypse difficulty are the real stars here.

They\'re a bit more interesting this time around, and a lot people return from the previous game (even ones you may not expect). The story is straightforward, and gives you bits of lore to fill in some gaps in the history of the timeline, and the only thing I can\'t say for certain at the time of this review is if the core plot of the series is finally resolved, as there is still DLC coming. Speaking of! the first DLC, The Awakened King, is fantastic, and bodes well for the rest of the game.

Remnant 2: An In-Depth ReviewRemnant 2, the long-awaited sequel to the Souls-like shooter Remnant: From the Ashes, arrived in July 2023. So, after months of exploration, boss battles, and loot drops, is it a worthy successor? Let\'s delve deep into the world of Remnant 2 and see what\'s in store.Story & Worldbuilding:The narrative takes place years after the events of the first game. The Root has seemingly been defeated, but its remnants still plague the world. As a \"Scour\" tasked with rebuilding civilization, you\'ll travel through procedurally generated worlds called \"Wards\" brimming with hostile creatures and environmental hazards. While the story takes a backseat to the gameplay, it provides enough intrigue and lore to keep you invested, with cryptic messages and environmental storytelling adding depth.Gameplay & Combat:Remnant 2 shines in its refined combat. The satisfying gunplay combines with strategic melee options, demanding mastery of both to tackle the diverse enemy roster. Dodging, parrying, and weapon mods add layers of complexity, creating a rewarding loop of learning enemy patterns and exploiting weaknesses. The addition of four distinct archetypes (Handler, Hunter, Challenger, Medic) and multi-classing opens up diverse character builds and playstyles, catering to various preferences.Level Design & Progression:The procedurally generated Wards offer surprising variety in environments and enemy encounters. Each playthrough feels fresh, ensuring replayability. However, the lack of handholding can be frustrating at times, with unclear objectives and map navigation demanding player initiative. Progression feels satisfying, with loot drops rewarding exploration and experimentation. The crafting system lets you tailor weapons and armor to your preferred playstyle, further enhancing the sense of customization.Multiplayer & Co-op:Remnant 2 shines in its co-operative aspect. Up to three players can tackle the Wards together, creating a fun and challenging experience. Sharing resources, reviving fallen comrades, and coordinating strategies adds another layer of depth to the gameplay. However, some technical issues like inconsistent hit registration and frame drops can dampen the co-op experience.Technical Aspects:The visuals are decent, with detailed environments and impressive boss designs. However, certain textures and animations lack polish. Performance is generally smooth on higher-end hardware, but frame drops and minor technical hiccups can occasionally disrupt the flow.Overall Verdict:Remnant 2 is a solid evolution of its predecessor. The refined combat, diverse world design, and satisfying loot loop offer a deeply engaging experience. While the story takes a backseat and technical issues persist, the core gameplay loop and co-op potential are undoubtedly captivating. If you enjoyed the first Remnant or crave a challenging Souls-like shooter with unique twists, Remnant 2 is definitely worth diving into.Here are some additional points to consider:    The difficulty curve can be steep, especially for newcomers to the genre.    The lack of fast travel in Adventure Mode can feel tedious at times.    The ending might leave some players wanting more closure.Final Score: 8/10Remnant 2 is a rewarding and challenging experience that builds upon the foundations of its predecessor. While not without its flaws, it offers a unique blend of Souls-like action, shooter mechanics, and procedural worldbuilding that will keep you hooked for hours on end.I hope this in-depth review provides you with a comprehensive understanding of Remnant 2 and helps you decide whether it\'s the right game for you.

That said, if you are a part of the community it apparently was intended for or enjoy the \"culture\", then you might enjoy it.

It doesn\'t quite achieve rogue-like or base-building legendary status, but the overall package is elevated higher than its reach.StoryYou\'re a lamb sacrificed by four gods named \"the bishops of old faith.\" Upon death, you meet an imprisoned fifth bishop named \"The One Who Waits.\" The One Who Waits provides a crown embued with godly powers, tasks you to start a cult in his name, and kill the other four bishops.The story is a simple one, but I never felt I wanted more. It\'s a solid foundation for satirical humor, and the religious references are funny and land often.As things progress the game rewards you with little tidbits about your origin and place among the bishops. It\'s all light fare and works well.GameplayI didn\'t know I needed a genre blend of rogue-like, bullet-hell combat combined with the progression of a base-builder, but it\'s a beautiful balance.Combining these genres creates a nice pace where you do a dungeon run to collect resources and hurry home to take care of your followers. The flow is reinforced by a daily timer prominently displayed at all times. I also appreciated how your cult\'s base progression advances combat strength. Outside of combat and base building is a variety of minigames, including fishing, a gambling dice-based game, and other cults to visit and exploit.Base Building and Your CultThe gameplay is fun and addicting but never very deep.There are familiar elements like resource gathering to build new structures and you can refine resources to create more advanced structures.You need to farm to feed your growing cult and use their feces to fertilize new crops. If followers get hungry or unhappy for any reason, they will dissent and start spreading ant-gospel to everyone else. You can then imprison them until they learn to behave or sacrifice them for meat to feed followers.Followers level up, and you can send them on adventures to get resources or bring back new people to indoctrinate.There is the ability to customize every follower\'s appearance and there are endless unlockable decorations to personalize your base.The base-building gameplay loop is tied to the cycle of a new day. Each day resets cooldowns like sermons and rituals. Both sermons and rituals boost cult morale. However, rituals have special effects like making everyone feel full for a couple of days, motivated to work tirelessly through the night, or building extra devotion by marrying a follower (wed multiple if you want but they\'ll get jealous when they witness you smooch another.) You can then extract devotion to level up combat abilities or unlock new structures.Base progression is well done, and I liked how advanced structures automated farming and other mundane tasks. I was growing bored of some repetitive tasks right around the time I unlocked structures that let my cult do it for me. Nothing is overly complex or overstays it\'s welcome.Adventuring and Killing in the Name of Your GodAs with base-building, the combat part is also pretty simple. There is a spammable weapon attack, a dodge-roll, a resource-based magic ability, and a charge attack that uses the same magic resource but at a slower rate.There are several weapon types, such as daggers, swords, axes, and heavy hammers. The only change in gameplay from weapons is attack speed, damage, and how long you\'re left open after an attack. Weapons can also have a single modifier type. There is nothing too crazy here with the usual assortment of poison, crits, health-leeching, or the chance to spawn a little ghost that will attack a nearby enemy. All the modifiers play the same and only add more random damage that the player doesn\'t control. The crit weapons always give the most bonus and make other options feel trivial.Enemies range in size, speed, and attack patterns. They flash a moment before they attack. You can dodge-roll at any time and even when charging up your own attack. Other enemies spew projectiles on the screen in bullet-hell fashion.Your first priority is to avoid damage. Watch for the spew of bullets and enemy charge attacks. Next, get in as much damage as you can. Each weapon has a combo string, with the final hit doing a nice bit of extra damage. The slower the weapon, the shorter the string. There are also charge attacks, but I never found them to be an efficient use of your magic resource.There are a bunch of magic cooldowns with various ranges and functionality like AOE pushbacks, long-range seeking missiles, and temporary invincibility. The resource requirement is well-tuned, and abilities feel powerful but not overpowered.The combat loop is fast and fun, if rarely challenging for the seasoned player of these genres. GraphicsCult of the Lamb lives on its presentation and deservedly so. You can\'t go wrong with cute animals and satanic overtones. Every sprite is lovingly crafted and often hilarious. The animations are excellent, too. I never grew tired of watching Lambert open his cult bible, hover in the air, and extract every bit of devotion from his followers.There is a large cast of characters and places to see other than your own base and the procedural dungeons. One favorite was a town where the cult leader was obsessed with gold and all things shiny. All his followers were dipped in melted gold and could only shake to acknowledge his presence.SoundThe music is catchy and memorable. I liked the sound effects, too. With any base-building game, you\'re bound to hear the same blips and beeps over and over. The effects were always crispy and satisfying. There is no voice acting, but the animalese-like chatter is themed to each character. The spider has a SssSss to his voice, and the fish has an underwater blooping to his tone. The voices always made me laugh.ConclusionCult of the Lamb is a smart game with tons of features and ideas going for it. That said, it plays things safe. The base building is approachable but too simple and one step away from greatness. The combat is good but never as exhilarating as some of its rogue-like peers. However, the presentation and humor are excellent and make Cult of the Lamb feel special enough not to be missed.ProsGenuinely funnyGreat pacing and blending of genresFun, addicting, and doesn\'t overstay its welcomeConsCombat would benefit from more varietyBase-building remains essentially the same from hour one to hour twentyChallengeI played the game on \"Very Hard.\" There are several levels of difficulty that adjust how much health you have, how much damage you take, and how quickly your followers get hungry or sick. I found the game relatively easy and desired a bit more challenge.

This game plays not like a Pokémon made for kids or to print money but a game made for all ages, and a game made out of love and passion. I\'m so ashamed of myself for sleeping on this for so long. I bought it back when it came out and just never got around to playing it until now. Ironically enough, I kind of put it off a bit thinking it would be “yet another Pokémon clone.”I\'ll be transparent and say I haven\'t finished the game, but I\'m on track to doing so. It runs well enough on Steam Deck and utilizes the Godot game engine. My playtime has been split between playing on my laptop and playing on my Steam Deck. I leave it set to 50 Hz on Steam Deck, and leave all other battery settings at their default values. Turn off half rate shading if you\'re using DeckyRecorder. HRS seems to cause some sort of flickering in footage. May cause epileptic episodes if you open footage without realizing you\'ve left HRS on. Steam Deck does get frame drops, and they are noticeable, but due to the nature of the gameplay, they are not game-breaking. I did get some crashes, and I think my issue was limiting the wattage to 13 instead of leaving the limiter off. I have been unable to recreate the crashes after setting wattage back to default. I don’t have an OLED model Steam Deck to compare, but the fans ramp up quite a bit on the old 512 GB LCD model Steam Deck.Cassette Beasts is 100% what I would call a wholesome and cozy game. It\'s got some creepiness and some cuteness. It’s got a good amount of diversity. It’s got some heartfelt moments, and some good potential for character development. There’s been some really clever moments that made me go “Huh. That’s interesting,” as well. I think I still have quite a bit left to do, and I\'ve been stumped a couple of times. The game could do with some more hints or giving more guidance on what you\'re supposed to do next at certain points. It just kind of started to slow down at one point, and I ended up wandering around until I stumbled into what I was supposed to do. This actually happened a couple of times during my play sessions.There’s some really good music in certain locations and boss battles of this game as well. I was in a cafe at one point and was suddenly hit with some music that took me aback for a moment. I wasn’t expecting that kind of vibe from this game going into it. As a music lover, I can’t help but love the record-themed stages. The first boss encounter had a really good song, as well. Not quite the kind of music I was expecting from this game, but definitely not disappointing by any stretch. I find the fusion and cassette/recording mechanics to be really interesting. They’re a good twist on the monster collector formula. Type matches and mismatches, abilities, buffs, and debuffs all feel really good to me. They’re fun to play around with, and they make sense in this game’s world. I really like the way the leveling system is implemented as well. I never felt like I was hindered by the beasts I wanted to use. Your beasts level up, evolve, and all that good stuff. However, your player character also levels up. That’s the interesting part. There’s a lot to play around with here, and a lot of interesting twists on the monster collecting genre. It’s really not “just another Pokémon clone.”To just describe it as “Pokémon but better” or something along those lines is to do Cassette Beasts dirty. It’s so much more than that. It’s a love letter to what made those classic Pokémon and Zelda games great. It wears its inspiration on its sleeve, and it does it in the best way possible.Pick this one up. Buy it on sale if you want, but I think it’s worth the full asking price.',''),(1759,'I\'ve had a lot of luck when trying out new genres the past couple of years.  Cassette Beasts was no exception.  This game constitutes my first JRPG and first Creature Capture game (nope, I\'ve never played a Pokémon game). I must admit this game has been a ton of fun. The music is quite catchy and the main song is very peaceful. It has an \"I ❤️ the 80s\" retro theme with its pixelated graphics, limited voice acting and character wardrobe. None of which took away from the gaming experience in 2023. The gameplay is enjoyable with plenty to do on a large map... you can even play with a friend!  Most of the tasks are fairly straight forward, but if you want to 💯 the achievements you will have to grind to find at least one of every bootleg type, obtain a copy of every beast and obtain additional info on every beast (there are a lot of beasts, evolutions and fusions). You can adjust the difficulty to your preferences, but I found the default to be very enjoyable.The price is extraordinarily reasonable. At $19.99 you can feel good picking up this game at full price... on any sort of discount, it\'s a steal. In fact, the devs could have fairly priced it at $24.99- $29.99, but I do appreciate the lower price point. I haven\'t said anything about the story or gameplay. Both are interesting and engaging. Most of you are better gamers than I, so suffice it to say,  \"you won\'t have much trouble naturally figuring out some of the less obvious elements as you progress through the game.\" ... battle strategy, chemistry, how/ where to find bootleg beasts, etc... and for the things that weren\'t intuitive to me (like how the heck do you beat a ghost!? And where on New Wirrell is that gold coin??), steam guides and youtube videos have been a big help.This one\'s a 10/10 for me. It\'s not a perfect game by any means, but the devs have given it a ton of love and it has been a real treat to play. I strongly recommend you give it a try.',''),(1760,'it\'s good and i do recommend it, but there\'s definitely a few problems. first, the good everyone mentions is rly good. the music is shockingly good, the monster designs are great, the characters are a little 1.5 dimensional but are still very enjoyable with overall pleasant art. when the game opens up, the world feels really fun to collect stuff in. the story is alright, it has some very charming subplots and the ending is good, but everything working up to the payoff is pretty shallow. the main problem with the game, for me, was that it is too open ended. i feel like i stumbled upon almost everything i was supposed to do, which i think to some players that\'s great, but i didn\'t feel like i discovered anything, i just wondered over to the next open-world-collectible/miniboss. the world is very diorama-esc, which makes it feel very... game-y. again, this likely really appeals to some players, but it made it hard for me to feel emotionally invested in almost anything in the game, and it seems like the game wanted me to be invested. i never felt a narrative arc, no sense of escalation or pressure, just wandering around finding stuff until the game says i found enough stuff to unlock the final last stuff to beat the game. the villain is present here and there but in the most indirect ways, almost every goal of the game is just to gather more resources, do little platforming puzzles (that were fun enough, if a little stale towards the end), or go fight X thing. because it can be done so open ended-ly, they all have to just be kinda hanging out in plain sight, and i started to get serious open-world-game-fatigue.this is not helped by the fact that the game tries to guide you via the level curve of certain areas, but by the midway point you can go most places as it is very open ended, which creates the problem that pokemon gold/silver had: the beginning is strangely hard as it tries to bottleneck you into the areas where you first level up, and then the mid to late game is suddenly incredibly easy once you start to outpace the remaining sections in levels. the post game it gets a little bit harder again, but strategy in the game is WAY more free-from than pokemon, which at first is really fun as you get to handcraft kinda broken strategies by holding onto all moves (stickers) and applying them to the appropriate CBs, with some pretty absurd (and not the best balanced) passives. However, this gets old when you realize the opponents do not have the same access to strategy, or else they too could create CBs that have like a 20% chance to instantly nuke your first starting CBs and maybe even you or your partner. so by the time you get to the end game, you will likely know a few nigh unbeatable strats if your CBs are in a remotely similar level range as your opponent.overall, i\'m critiquing the game a lot despite the fact that it is really pleasant to play, just because some of the core design detracts so much from what is good about the game for certain players. it\'s good to set your expectations accordingly. i honestly still recommend it to pretty much anyone: the music, the visuals, the area design, the side quests, collecting monsters, building your character, all of that stuff is incredibly fun. the game manages to be very funny as well. but if you aren\'t a huge open world fan, keep that in mind.',''),(1761,'it just drips charm. every sprite and detail has surprising amounts of thought put in. the type system is clever and pretty intuitive. i hope they get online features now or in a future installment. i see this franchise growing a very loyal fan base if they continue to treat their projects with respect',''),(1762,'I am shocked.

The music is so good',''),(1768,'++TLDR: This is a fantastic monster taming game with fun exploration, an interesting story, and great combat mechanics.  However, there are areas for improvement with art, odd filler content, and some combat mechanics.PROS:+The game is open world, though some of this doesn\'t open up until you learn certain abilities.  This makes exploration quite interesting throughout the game.  And, by the end of the game, since the abilities that enhance your exploration allow things like double-jumping and gliding, moving around is an enjoyable breeze.+The game introduces mechanics to replace weakness and resistance, which is a breath of fresh air.  Rather, type-advantages cause temporary buffs and debuffs, which, when explained by the in-game tutorials are both hilarious and logical at the same time.+Combat is made more interesting by introducing a point system that allows different moves based on the available points.  Higher hitting attacks cost more points to use, so players need to ramp up and balance their turns instead of spamming heavy hitting attacks every turn.+The game introduces relationship strength to encourage players to pick combat partners and explore their storylines more extensively.  By the end of the game, I had unlocked several interesting combat partners to fight with.  SPOILER: Exploring multiple relationships and growing the partners and their beasts actually matters for the final boss fight.+Puzzles exist in this game and sometimes offer a challenge.  This was greatly missed from games like Pokemon that oddly have removed those in the last several generations.+The story is quite interesting and has multiple, interesting twists.CONS:-Combat can be slow because of the points system the game introduces.  This means that some fights against lower level monsters can drag on and cost HPs desired for a boss fight.  By the end of the game, I was largely trying to avoid fights.-Some of the anime art for the characters seemed very amateur.  I would hope that if there\'s a sequel, more money is put into hiring a better artist that could channel a similar, but more professional vibe for the game.-While exploring, the perspectives sometimes change.  This is interesting when that reveals new, hidden, areas, but often just became frustrating having to change controls or watch the camera shift often just because I\'m near the border of an area where the perspective shifts back and forth.-Some of the characters had random interactions to reveal they were gay.  Though, there really was no plot enhancement or story that this added and this never came up for more than 10-15 seconds.  Rather, this seems shoehorned into the game for no apparent reason other than \"inclusivity.\"  I\'d rather this be more fleshed-out if it\'s going to be in the game.  In this case, I just groaned.',''),(1769,'8 hours in and I can say I\'m really enjoying the game, I love that you can merge the monsters and everything, it\'s a very cool rpg!',''),(1770,'One of my fav game in years. Pros: - Cute pixel art graphics.- Open world works great. The game can get easy as you become stronger than certain areas, but I did not care: I had creatures to evolve and the fights can be quick enough that It was not a problem. - Exploration is fun. There are secrets to discover and map abilities to unlock. - The story is also interesting and delves into some interesting existentialist questions. - Great variety of creatures to evolve and develop. - Creatures can be modified considerably. Lots of fun combos to try and put together- So many types vs types effects. Looks overwhelming, but I learned them fairly quickly and they add a lot to the fights and strategies- Not too long. I finished the game in 35 hours. I wanted more when I was done, which is rare for me. I usually rush to finish a game in order to start a new one.

Amazing soundtrack. Story seems deeper than just \"collect all monsters\" & \"beat all trainers\". It is visible that a lot of heart and passion went into this!',''),(1775,'game of the year frfr',''),(1776,'Cassette Beasts is the newcomer in the recent slew of monster-taming games, a genre that has mostly been content to follow the ropes and tropes set by a particular market leader. But I’m happy to report Cassette Beasts carves a new path through subverting expectations and refining the genre in ways you might not even realise you want.Let’s start with the main event – the combat. Cassette Beasts’ combat is focused on ‘energy,’ a resource that needs strategic management and preservation. Every turn you’ll gain a fixed amount of energy and any decent move has an associated energy cost. Between those powerful attacks your turns will be spent playing defensive options or doing mild chip damage. It’s reminiscent of the sort of resource management you’d find in tabletop games and interesting tradeoffs naturally emerge, even in wild battles that would feel inconsequential in other RPGs.These interesting play mechanics are all enhanced by Cassette Beasts solely featuring Double Battles and dedicating a significant proportion of its moves to enhancing or protecting your team mate. The combat possibilities are dizzying and the best indicator of those possibilities is in Cassette Beast’s equivalent of ‘Gyms,’ which are not based on monster types but each instead showcases an entirely unique battle strategy. It’s great stuff.I also never stuck to a single strategy thanks to team experimentation being made trivial. Experience persists across all your monsters and attacks can be outright transferred between them (so long as the receiving monster’s movepool accepts it). Once any final evolution was reached I swapped them out, meaning I was able to progress both the bestiary and storyline without falling behind the level curve, creating a rewarding sense of progression.Said story is well-planned - a somewhat sombre reflection on nostalgic escapism and those themes will resonate with the target audience. The execution is serviceable, is filled with late 90\'s charm, and the boss battles along the way are a stylish highlight. However, I do think more sidekick-focused quests would have helped flesh out the characterisation, as the game lacks that immersive ‘ensemble goes questing’ feeling you might desire in your RPGs. I think some of that comes down to a lack of “quality time” you get to spend with the cast, so keep those expectations in check.On the topic of characters I’d say ‘creature designs’ are typically the weakest point of other monster-taming games, but Cassette Beasts bucks the trend by drawing from a range of inspirations while weaving a consistent design language throughout. The spectrum goes from ‘adorable’ to ‘edgelord’ while always maintaining a unique ‘Cassette Beast’ feel. Shoutouts to ‘Djinn Entonic’, ‘Brushroom’ and ‘Elfless’ (my beloved).My only major gripe here is navigating the overworld, there’s significant traversal stutter when moving at pace and the visuals are just about adequate (in comparison to the excellent monster sprites). It also takes a while to unlock your full navigation moveset and the interim does feel like something is ‘missing’ which makes for a bad first impression. Keep at it though, once you unlock the Bulletino Dash everything will start to click.So, to summarise, Cassette Beasts may be the monster-taming newcomer but imo it’s the most interesting of the lot. Serious effort has gone into identifying and challenging genre staples and using them as opportunities to innovate. I’ve kept details about a lot of that polish vague because the best bit of Cassette Beasts is in the surprises and delights you’ll discover along the journey. To any fans of turn-based battles seeking interesting yet accessible gameplay then Cassette Beasts is the one to grab. Highly recommended!',''),(1777,'the only game ive been able to get a shiny in :,)',''),(1778,'Pros:- Good music- Not bad idea in general.Cons:- The game contains denuvo malware.- The EULA is absolutely unreasonable, they can do whatever they want with your personal data and are not responsible for anything.

Scam tactics.- A lot of unfinished and/or unbalanced mechanics.- AI is amazingly dumb.The most frustrating mechanic is happiness.

And I play Anno in normal speed. I like slow builders. This one goes no where and take forever to get there. Even the RTS combat lacks all forms of excitement. The NPCs just stand in place, shooting/swinging on their turn like its 1998. And why is this a space game? Last map I played looked like Utah. No space suits. No zero G. Nothing Space unless you count the skin swapped, very earth like, creatures. I don\'t. There is no game design beyond what has been stolen from other, more competent, developers. Bugs will attack your base like clockwork, their numbers inching up each time. Each area is dominated by a resource while lacking the others. This means your building will all be the same. You start with 4 people that burden the load and as your camp grows, well you better hope they don\'t die cause you may very well never see another person. Wooohoo....fun? A city builder that just makes you spread your labor paper thin. No, fun it is not. TL:DR It\'s just boring. I played on 3X speed the whole time and that wasn\'t enough for an exciting pace. As I progressed I never felt accomplished, nor the desire to continue.',''),(1782,'Really fun even if all your survivors want to kill each other by day 4',''),(1783,'Stranded: Alien Dawn introduction starts you out with a cool spaceship crash to begin your adventure.

You can make the game difficult and a fight for survival or just go and enjoy a game that is a wonderful combination of Rimworld and The Sims.',''),(1788,'A great colony sim and base building game, with mechanics in place to slowly ratchet up difficulty against you so that you have to stay on your toes. And slowly is right - unless you really dawdle, you should be able to stay well ahead of the curve in normal difficulty ranges. I like the additional requirements of having to observe and understand local resources before you can use them - although I don\'t love that random seeds will also sometimes shut you out of certain resources. By the same token, access to new crewmembers, which is vital to thriving in this game, is very RNG dependent - some seeds will have folks walking into your camp, and some won\'t have you run across a savable survivor for years.All in all, though, a solid, enjoyable game with a good production loop. Recent updates have added quality of life concerns, easing development building and helping with late game gathering and production. Well worth your time.',''),(1789,'My recommendation is that if you have never played RimWorld, try that first.  Overall it\'s a better version of this game.  If you have played Rimworld but it was too complicated to enjoy, S:AD may be a better fit for you and you should give it a try (or if you can\'t get into the simple graphics and think the 3D will help).  But if you are a Rimworld expert S:AD will probably be a disappointment for you due to lack of depth in the management tools and how unbalanced a lot of things are.Tl;dr - Stranded Alien Dawn is good but definitely lacks polish considering it is a copy of Rimworld.  Many shortcomings feel like a combination of the devs being lazy and not actually playing their own game to experience how frustrating some mechanics are firsthand, which is sad.  Hopefully it gets some balance changes in the future, but the fact it hasn\'t yet this long after launch makes me doubt that will happen.The game is basically a simplified version of Rimworld with 3D graphics.  Almost all the mechanics are identical but the management systems aren\'t as fleshed out.  For example, clothing wears out the same as in Rimworld, but you need to manually tell colonists when you want them to change gear instead of being able to set a threshold where they automatically switch out what they are wearing when it gets too worn out.  And then you need to manually mark worn out gear to get scrapped instead of having anything below a certain HP automatically get scrapped.Same thing with the storage system.  Containers have a \"Store here first\" option you can check to prioritize where items get put first but if you want something stored in multiple places (ex. food in the fridge, but then also wanting a container near barrels to make loading them quicker) you are out of luck.  You also have to choose between allowing any item on the approved list take up the entire container or limit each approved item to only 1 stack.  So if you have only two items you want to store but want to ensure there is always space for some of both you\'re forced into leaving the container half empty.  Meanwhile Rimworld lets you set storage priority order and set specific limits on each item in storage.  Hell, you can customize each crafting job to specify which stockpile to get inputs from and where to store the item when it\'s finished!  In this you have 0 control over any of that.Another example is the taming menu, which does show growth and fattening %, training level, etc, but for some reason isn\'t filterable/sortable and doesn\'t show which animals are pregnant.  And selecting an animal from the taming list doesn\'t actually select them either, just centers the camera (which has a menu over it) on the animal.  So if it\'s in a crowd you end up needing to click through them individually anyway.Crafting times are very long and doesn\'t seem to be impacted by colonist level much either.   It\'s impossible to find info on how each level affects crafting speed but I think someone at level 10 crafts something 2.5-3x faster than someone at level 0.  So assuming that is true, a crossbow would take 10 hours to craft at level 0 and 3.33 hours at level 10.  To craft a full set of clothes for a colonist it takes 60 hours (at level 0) of crafting time: shirt-12, pants - 12, vest - 18, boots - 12, helmet - 6.  So even at level 10 it will take at least 20 hours.  And then you can only use 50% of the clothes health before colonists complain they are worn out and need to be replaced.',''),(1790,'very nice detailed survival base builder',''),(1791,'Solid game.

I really like the idea, but my biggest issue is there\'s a lack of ability to really micromanage people.

The ever increasing enemy waves is irritating as well. I just want to build out my initial base without too much hostility, then hostility can come.

Its usually the cannibals in the afternoon around 14:00 and two or three times a season at night around 23:00 the mutants come out. There\'s no hunting, in fact, there\'s barely any wildlife. No quests or side objectives, there is actually no reason to explore almost 80% of the map as all of the story objectives are on one side or 15 -20% of the map. They did spread the inventory items around the map a little better than they were for early release, but once you have them there is no reason to be on that side of the world unless you just want to be.I wound up making a save where I flew around the map spawning thousands of extra enemies just to make it interesting for a fresh play through.I do think this would be a great game for groups to play together, especially if one person is acting like a DM.

The inventory system is just as annoying, but at least it\'s expanded.  Most mechanics are also similar to the first game and they kept the immersive nature of performing an action, regardless of how little sense it makes.The island is beautiful and much larger than the first game.  The map is actual GPS so much easier to see where your character is.  The inhabitants on the island are new and interesting and difficult.  There are multiple types of mutants and cannibals and they act different from each other.  Some of the events while adventuring through the game definitely gave me pause and I admired them.However, the game just wasn\'t fun.Exploration of the island was dull.  It\'s massive and empty.  There aren\'t really many things to find.  And those things that you do find hardly further the plot.And there\'s not much plot.  The ending felt like it was part of a fever dream that I couldn\'t remember how I got there.  Too many of the clues were throw-away emails that weren\'t important.The combat was annoying.  It\'s difficult to find bullets and the melee combat mechanics aren\'t great.Building was pointless since there\'s no reason to keep a place to sleep.  You can complete the game easily without a base.  If you do choose to build, raids on your base show that defenses are largely ignored by enemies.  And the damage that some enemies did to some build pieces was far too high.There was no point to cooking.  Or really eating anything better than basic items.There were too many items that weren\'t required to progress the story.  We could have skipped half the game and accidentally beat it.There were too many bugs.  This is a more minor issue since at the time of this review the game is in early access.

For an early access game, I had very few issues. On my first play-through I reached a 50 million net worth with about 45 stores or so. When 0.4 came out I decided to start a new play-through as I didn\'t feel like figuring out what items needed to be fixed across all of my stores. There were of course some bugs on the new version but the dev team has been awesome about fixing them as quickly as they could even with the holiday\'s almost upon us. They dropped updates on the 13th, 14th and 23rd addressing the worst of the bugs.Gameplay:I personally love this style of game. A bigger city and more business would be great, but I think it’s already really good and more fun than most business sims I have played. 0.4 improved the driving which was one of my biggest issues besides the office-based businesses. Both were fixed which has improved the game and made it more engaging and fun. Being able to build out your various businesses, headquarters, and distribution networks is really satisfying.Areas that could improve:Late game:I feel like I am mostly just sleeping and doing all the happiness activities. So, it would be nice to see more activities and things to do in the city. I realize you can be very hands-on and design all of your stores, do your own deliveries etc, but I think most of us agree that would just get very repetitive and tedious.Character models:Currently not the greatest and maybe some love will be given to them eventually.Headquarters:The ability to move your HQ employees to a new HQ without losing your distribution plans, HR assigned employees, Purchase manager orders etc. Maybe a moving company could be added for when we want to move our HQ to a new location or something like that. Writing everything down when I upgrade to a new HQ is a pain.Add a Store Designer:One thing that would make life really great, would be having a store designer. It could be software you buy for your computer that gives you a new activity to do on your computer. It could also boost your happiness instead of having to game all the time. My thought is you could choose one of the floor plans and the business type. Then you could fully design and layout our store, save the design, and have the interior designers install it. This system could also be used to preview downloaded blueprints so we can get a better view of them before we waste money installing a design that we are not happy with. The current blueprint system makes it tough to see the designs so a designer could solve that problem while making it easier for us to design our stores before we open them. Having a lot of shipments get dropped off and grabbing them 4 items at a time with a dolly can be a pain and is time consuming. Closing:Overall, I love the game, though I do partially agree with a couple of the negative reviews that say there isn\'t enough variety between businesses as far as managing them goes.Thanks to the dev team for being responsive and quick to fix major bugs.

At the discounted price I\'d say go ahead and enjoy this pleasant little cat adventure. You\'ll find that the puzzles are of varied difficulty. My biggest drawback, however, is that the game is WAY too linear. Too many corridors where you feel like they haven\'t even tried to give the impression that you have a choice.

It works splendidly and gets regularly updated. The developers really have a vision and they believe in their project. The game itself is a solid town-builder with mission based levels, which doesn\'t drag the game too much. Once you have completed enough objectives, you can move on to another region. You can also continue building your town, if you want, but this doesn\'t get you anywhere further in the bigger picture of the game. It\'s just for us who have trouble letting go of the work we\'ve put in. I\'ve often had a problem with other building games that I build one city fanatically and after awhile I don\'t know what to do next and after one or two cities built I have a feeling I have seen all the game has to offer and I lose interest. Money not well spent. That is not the case here. You want to see where the story takes you. There are also different difficulties and seeing your townspeople die after you\'ve gotten greedy and stretched the materials you have too far, makes you lose hair. If you have any, luckily I don\'t. The game has many aspects and I don\'t even pretend to know half of them. Every town is a learning lesson, and you forget fast that the game is only in early access.Also the music is great!',''),(1852,'I don\'t remember now what I thought of originally when hearing \"rouguelit/ke citybuilder\" but this game obliterated whatever it was and fully cemented itself as the gold standard going forward. I\'ve been following this game\'s development through early access to release for quite awhile and it\'s been impressive the entire way. The devs behind this game are rockstars, consistently putting out updates at a regular rhythm, they\'re responsive to feedback, they\'re unafraid to make major tweaks and changes to the game to keep it in a healthy place. You don\'t often see a team that\'s okay with scrapping a feature that isn\'t working, iterating on it, and implementing something new, so swiftly. I have a lot of respect for them, honestly. And the game itself shows so much of their care, dedication, and skill. I\'m excited to see where they go from here (both with this game and any others they have planned). So, what\'s so great about Against the Storm? Why so much praise? Citybuilder games have a lot of great bits to them but there tends to be a point where things get bogged down and get tedious. Against the Storm\'s settlement system avoids this consistent issue with the citybuilding genre. The settlements tend to reach a point of completion before it hits that tedium. It doesn\'t overstay its welcome. Your goal as the player is to meet the demands of a distant but powerful Queen by building settlements out in the forest wilderness, in the relatively calm years between massive, devastating storms. You\'re effectively building supply lines for the last stronghold of civilization in an extremely hostile world, turned that way thanks to events in the long past involving forsaken gods, forbidden magic, etc. Each settlement/city is different thanks to the roguelike elements at play: the different possible biomes (each with differing resources available); the potential villager species that will be present in the city; which resources the caravan brings with them; what resources you pick to embark with; which building blueprints you have available at your first blueprint draw; what effects will be active in the different seasons for the duration of your city; etc. And that\'s just in the first minute or so of starting a new settlement. Things get more complicated as your woodcutters hack their way through the hostile forest to discover what\'s hidden in the fog-cloaked glades beyond. Will there be desperately needed resources? Allies to join your ranks? Riches? Or maybe devastation? Almost every challenge you face has multiple ways to meet it, with rewards that differ based on which way you choose to solve it. Do you choose to satisfy the needs of your people or the demands of the Queen? Every settlement you govern will require balancing those two aspects: you need happy people to survive but you also need to allay the Queen\'s Impatience. She\'s not very forgiving, you see. Making her too mad is one of the ways to fail a settlement: if her Impatience maxes out and you\'re unable to salvage it in the countdown grace period afterward. There are other ways to lose a settlement, but they tend to spiral in a way that leads to an angry Queen.If you want to almost always avoid an angry Queen situation, the flexible difficulty system has you covered. Though it will take longer, you can just play on easier difficulties and still enjoy the game. Cities take less time overall, but even if you\'ve met the requirements to complete the settlement, you can still continue afterwards. You won\'t get further meta-progression experience for that, but hey, sometimes you just wanna open more glades, explore, and relax. Other times, you may want to seek out a more brutal experience. With 24 levels of difficulty, Against the Storm has you covered. And it\'s not difficulty that\'s tacked on by inflating numbers or making everything just take longer like a citybuilding equivalent of a bulletsponge wave of enemies. After the first handful of increases in difficulty, you unlock the Prestige levels, each of which adds on a different effect that makes balancing things harder. You need flexibility and a strong foundation of managing the flow of the game to succeed consistently, but it\'s very rewarding. This review already very long and I could talk about this game for hours (and honestly, I have). But some other things I love about this game: - The UI is so good. Nearly everything you would want in a citybuilder UI is there. If you wonder \"Hey, it\'d be neat if I could do X\" it\'s probably already implemented. - The music is great. Each biome has its own set of music, with some overlap and it\'s just great- Art direction is so good. - The world lore is great and I want to devour more of it. - Foxes won the poll and they\'re my favorite species by far. They\'re a bit delicate but treat them right and they\'re run away with a victory every time. - The rain and storm sounds are so good. It\'s definitely a factor in why I have so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hours in this gameAnd now for the cons: - I do wish there was just a very chill, low-difficulty mode that requires a lot of Reputation, so it takes forever but is just low key. Like, maybe custom parameter modes or something. Basically, I want a Settler/Pioneer-difficulty level settlement but with the game length of Prestige levels or something. - Frogs and Bats lost the poll to Foxes and I\'m sad they\'re not (yet) in the game. If any of the above piqued your interest, then get this game. It\'s great. Oh, one last thing, and a bit of advice: Harpies seems like pathetic, delicate flowers that wither the second you\'re not looking at them, which basically IS true. BUT, if you pamper them, they absolutely will deliver you a victory in near record time.',''),(1853,'This is it!  This is the perfect game for me... and it might just be for you, too.Do you really like city builders, but always find yourself getting bored or distracted and moving on to something else?  Really enjoy the initial base/city/planning aspects of those games but get bogged down in late game bureaucracy and tedious micro-management?If so, this game also might be for you!Against the Storm is the bite-size city builder that I didn\'t know I needed.  Enjoy the early stages of getting a base up and running, and just when things start to cross into the realm of tedium... you win (...or lose) and move on to the next settlement.  This core structure along with the fantastic and innumerable combinations of races, biomes, available resources, buildings, perks, etc. ensure you\'re never playing the same game twice.  Each settlement instance comes with new challenges to overcome in new ways.  A well developed and rewarding tech tree, secondary and tertiary rouge-lite elements, and a procedurally generated world map with different settlement modifiers and challenges ensure I will be playing this game for a long time to come.  With ~50 hours into the game currently, I can safely say I will get 200+ more hours of fun out of Against the Storm.Good luck out there, viceroy!  The Scorched Queen needs you!',''),(1854,'By far one of the best games I have ever played. A breath of fresh air in the city builder genre, with a unique blend of roguelite mechanics that ensure no two runs are exactly a like.',''),(1855,'First up, I don\'t think this is a terrible game, but it wasn\'t what I was expecting and I didn\'t find it very fulfilling. If you\'re here purely for challenging game mechanics, this might be fun. If you\'re hoping to enter a beautiful world (which it is), interact with it and shape it to your liking, I don\'t think this is what the developers were going for.The game is basically like a card game: you have a hand X, the table looks like Y, can you eke out a victory with the pieces available to you.  The hand is the buildings and starting resources, the table is the settlement location and available resources/events, and the town is the result.You can\'t really develop a personal style.  You can\'t say, I\'m going to go all-in on this race (you get other races anyway, and if you don\'t meet their needs it drags the entire settlement down, so you end up going for everything), or I\'m going to go all-in on this food source (because other races need other food sources), or I\'m going to go all in on exploring (because the exploration events require things you get by not going all-in on exploring, or require random races to be happy), or etc.The level up perks are the same: very general, not conducive to specializing.  The perks themselves are barely noticeable: 2% increase in X or Y, for things that you need regardless of how you might want to play.  You don\'t unlock a perk and enter the game and feel like you\'ve opened up some new play style, or can now do something you previously couldn\'t.  You don\'t challenge yourself by choosing a new way to try playing, the game challenges you (by making happiness drop faster).And I feel like the game mechanics are specifically chosen to make it hard to find synergies, or eke out bonuses or whatever.  It\'s like, if you get race X, the game gives you non-synergistic resource Y in the map and events about Z.  Nothing ever aligns, and you never end up with some massive windfall at the end.',''),(1856,'Frostpunk. Anno. Ixion. Factorio... sort of. Did you like those games?Against the Storm is not like those games.Against the Storm is what you get if you took the central premise of those games -- build fragile logistics chains while coping with ever-increasing external and internal pressures -- and squished it down into a 2-hour loop that demands not planning, not save-scumming, and not perfection, but improvisation. Rapid improvisation. And then, when you limp across the finish line (or collapse before you make it), it throws all your work away -- victories and failures both -- and asks you to try again.Anno and Factorio\'s predictable chain of increasingly-complex logistics chains? GONE. Now you have a Lego box of random buildings, and SOME of them will do KIND of what you want! Pick one of three! There are still logistics chains, but now you only get half of them at once! What about the rest? MAKE DO.Frostpunk and Ixion\'s love of punishing you for mistakes you made six hours ago? GONE. SORT OF. Now, thanks to the weather system, most of your mistakes arrive with LIGHTNING SPEED. But you can fix the problems just as fast, no perfection necessary! If you make a mess, who cares? Soon enough you\'ll be getting a new town anyway!Against the Storm is a city builder without equal. Not hyperbole: as of this review, I know of no game like it.So, if you like city builders -- or if you don\'t -- then you owe it to yourself to give Against the Storm a try.Bring an umbrella.',''),(1857,'I recommend - but.. I am one of those 30+ guys that are not easily swayed by games anymore, and I don\'t have a cracy amount of energy to research how to play a game either. I want original, high quality and I want \"easy to learn, hard to master\". This game delivered on the first two. I felt very drawn to this game due to the art style and top down look, reminiscent of Warcraft 3. While I knew going in it\'s a very different game, I allowed the nostalgia to rip at my heart strings none the less while welcoming the originality I read the game was being praised for. I was prepared for a new type of experience! And I gave it an honest go. I\'m 10 hours in, I\'ve played several levels, including two tutorial levels, and I have watched about 1 hour of beginner guides on youtube. I am STARTING to get it now, and it is STARTING to get a little fun. Veeeery slowly. But while I get the basics, there is still so much that I feel I need to learn or remember during a level, in order to really enjoy it. The amount of micro management here is quite insane.And after 10 hours, I can\' help but to find it a bit overwhelming that I am still burning so much calories getting through a single game constantly checking this, checking that, pausing the game to read up on such, and google what that does, and so on and so fort. Even the interface when choosing levels is something of an element to understand all on it\'s own.This game seems very much so like a gem, I can see that, but don\'t be fooled - it will require time to feel like you are mastering it. Be prepared to put in the effort, and Im am sure this can be quite the experience. If you are like me and want a game, ok with a learning curve but don\'t want to feel like you need university classes before you can feel like your are doing something right, then you might want to reconsider this one. We\'ll see if I continue, and despite my negativity, I will praise the developers for what seems to be high quality, original gaming. Just because it might not be for me, I can surely recognize it as great!',''),(1858,'I bought this game in Q1 of 2023, and I already have 100 hours of playtime on it. It was so fun and addicting that I had to uninstall it so that I wouldn\'t have the option to launch it whenever I open Steam.Essentially, the game is a city-builder/production chain mix with roguelite elements. Every run is around 30 minutes to 1 hour.What impresses me the most about this game is that every mechanic is multi-purpose, and this design allows the player to improvise so that each run is always playable and that the player always has an out. For instance, every quest has two or more ways to complete it, raw materials can be refined in many ways and all buildings have three or more functions. Another mechanic that I want to give a shout-out to is the victory/defeat condition. Both are not only used for tracking when the game will end, but in tandem, they will give you a bonus modifier that is integral to the game. Lastly, it includes a \"prestige\" difficulty scaling similar to Slay the Spire\'s ascension.',''),(1859,'TLDR: Try it but keep an eye on your play time; I was 50-50 about this game. I only went for negative once I saw fans are attempting to discourage negative reviews by clowning them all, since I feel I might be balancing out other people who didn\'t have a great time but were put off by the trolls.Speaking more charitably to start with, I would suggest that if you\'re looking for a city-builder sim, you\'ll probably enjoy this. It\'s a beautiful and well-polished optimisation game; almost like a cutesy Factorio base building game. Speaking less charitably, I might ask: are you looking for an unpaid second job as a clerical assistant? If so, boy is this the game for you! If you dislike tedious administrative work being sold as a recreational experience via pretty graphics, however, you\'re probably better off steering clear. The only \"stakes\" here are a built in doom clock of sorts for the base building and task management that various busywork pushes back - there\'s no actual combat, TD, strategy-micro or anything of that nature. Imagine base building macro from a strategy game but that\'s it - the game never eventually builds up to some sort of battle or big adventure or anything - the best analogy I think of would be like an entire game designed around base-building from AOE III; it\'s all about optimal worker assignment, building placement and workflow creation to earn more resource-drops. If you\'re into that sort of thing, frankly I don\'t see why you wouldn\'t just go play Civ to scratch that same itch plus a whole lot more at the same time.So anyway, it might be a gem for some - and judging by the review score, it was a gem for many - but it\'s definitely not for me. Frankly, it\'s way too similar to stuff that I could be paid real money to do in the business world, and contrary to the \"overwhelmingly positive\" status this game currently has, I think there\'s very much a non-zero chance that it won\'t be for you either, because it has the \"strategy\" tag and this will catch many inappropriate 4X type players in the drag net. I definitely wouldn\'t go so far as to suggest people shouldn\'t go ahead and at least give it a go, though, it\'s by no means a bad game per se, I\'d just suggest to keep an eye on your playtime so you don\'t find yourself unable to refund if it\'s not really your cup of tea, because this is definitely a game that hints at something more that\'s not coming in the first 2 hours.To the fanboys jestering all the negative reviews in an effort to discourage critics, you should know that as I mentioned at the start I probably just would have stayed neutral if not for you. I feel even more duty-bound to leave my honest opinion when I see this happening. There\'s nothing wrong with leaving honest negative feedback - prospective buyers are interested in all genuine opinions - people that do this because they invested their personal identity in a game and feel personally attacked somehow by a negative review for a game they didn\'t even design or develop need to grow up.',''),(1860,'The gameplay mechanics are convoluted and winning is not particularly rewarding. The game is cleanly set up into a set of gambling-type loops where you are always optimizing for some next goal with some set of unknowns on the next loop iteration (open next clearing in the forest, see next area on the map, see next map in cycle, etc)I gave it a ton of tries just because of the very high reviews, since on paper I feel I should like this game as well. But overall the gameplay was more frustrating than entertaining, probably because there are some 50% more resource/building types than would be actually enjoyable to maintain. Maybe it gets more fun as you build out a more encyclopedic understanding of all the effects, but, honestly, not for me.',''),(1861,'I have to, right now, with the saddest heart, give this game a thumbs down and I deeply, deeply hope I can change it down the line. All the amazing things other reviews say about this game are true. They absolutely are. The art, the gameplay, the atmosphere, the idea of a rougelite citybuilder - they are all amazing! The one thing that\'s not amazing is the presentation of the difficulties and how they are tied to story mode. And for me, this is gamebreaking.When you start the game, you get a list of difficulties and one of them - the apparently hardest - is locked until you beat the difficulty before that. Fair enough! The second difficulty appears to be the normal one (given the 1x reward multiplier) and in no way or form does the game tell you the truth. The truth is that there are twenty locked difficulties and to finish what the game presents you as storyline, you will have to master the hardest of them all, as the \'storyline quests\' have a set difficulty you need to use. The last storyline mission has the hardest difficulty; a difficulty you can\'t even see existing when you start the game.So people who buy this game will very likely be far more than two hours in when they realize that not just are they forced to play on high difficulties (which is, at first glance, totally optional), but also how many there are. I personally find the high difficulties not fun to play. That\'s it. They\'re absolutely doable, but I don\'t enjoy the amount of micromanagement and, to a lesser degree, RNG needed to succeed in them. I am more of a casual player and I am beyond demoralized that I got \'tricked\' into being invested into a story I will never finish unless I want to play the game in a way I don\'t like, which I won\'t do. I play games to have fun, after all.So this is, to me, a devastating flaw of the game. Not showing what is needed to play the storyline from the start by hiding 19 difficulties and also not making the storyline more accessible to lower-skill or more casual players is what currently makes me give this game a thumbs down. I hope that the devs, who have been, from what I heard, extremely engaged with the community, will change this down the line because it definitely sucked a lot of enthusiasm for the game out of me.',''),(1862,'Maybe there\'s a part I don\'t get but after 25 hours + playtime I have to say I\'m pretty disapointed. Game has a great metacritic review and a descent user score, but it\'s really, REALLY boring after you get the mechanics. Every game plays absolutely the same, minus minor roguelike variations that don\'t really change the gameplay.The queen\'s impatience \"mechanic\" is just a time limit and doesn\'t add anything new.Runs are waaaayyyy too long, and progression is an absolute grind. After 20+ games you kinda wonder where\'s the finality or what even is the point.There\'s no sense of progression whatsoever. So far I feel like I\'ve played about 30 identical games, you get locked in the same old build order you\'ll apply game after game. You\'ll build the same basic structures and layout ad nauseam, only to add minor variations in the endgame. For a roguelike, it\'s EXTREMELY repetitive, and you\'ll feel like you\'re playing the first level over and over and over again. No way as good as the reviews say it is.',''),(1863,'Great game if you enjoyed games such as Frostpunk, Northgard, but want more gameplay and replayability as well as diversity in how you go about winning. The game is balanced in the sense that you could take any approach (trading, farming, scouting etc) and it\'ll keep you invested for the whole match. I really like the progression system where you can accumulate boosts that aid you in completing the early parts so you can get further with each attempt. This has made the game replayable by letting you change each match, and strive to get further than before with a decent sized pool of randomized encounters making every game unique. Highly recommend, I will be looking forward to whatever the devs can throw at us in the future.',''),(1864,'I want to like this game, but the progression system is killing my enjoyment of it. While it is quite addictive, it is not fun to me anymore. I enjoyed the first 20ish hours, learning the systems, resources, map variations, figuring out strategies, etc. But after that early shine, it becomes a loooooong grind just to unlock everything and increase the difficulty, and frankly at this point I\'m not motivated anymore to see what the game really has to offer. Which is a shame, honestly. It doesn\'t feel fun enough anymore to justify grinding to the endgame content. It feels like I\'m wasting time until I can enjoy it, rather than enjoying it while wasting time.If there also was a way to just jump into the hardest mode with everything unlocked, this would be a thumbs up. Also a faster-than-x3 mode would also be appreciated. While I am a pause abuser when giving commands, x3 feels too slow while waiting for the next thing that needs attention.So I\'m going against the overwhelmingly positive storm by not recommending this game, purely due to the grind. I feel like I\'ve figured out the game but it won\'t let me remove the many training wheels that it has.',''),(1865,'I\'ve put quite a bit of time into this game, and it was addicting at first, but now I feel overall just frustrated.  I\'m not sure what the point of playing the game is, there\'s seems to be no end.  I\'m on a very high level, but I can\'t get enough money to actually feel like I level up.   I also feel like I never truly finish a settlement before I \"win\", and there are not enough blueprints available to be able to run the settlement as I would like.  So, as someone who doesn\'t have the time to play games all day long, I would pass on this one in favor of something with a clear endpoint, or even something that you could keep improving on.',''),(1866,'Not for the faint of heart. I really enjoyed this game when it first showed up on Steam and even managed to work my way to Prestige 16 which gave the game a feeling of satisfaction as I progressed through the upper ranks and had to really pull out some full stops to pull out some great wins. However, and this is something I thought I\'d never say, the devs have a vision for the game and I\'m not sure I\'m tracking it anymore. When I first played the game it felt challenging, but balanced. I like to think I enjoy a bit of cerebral play so I breezed through the first couple Prestiges but really had to focus and work pretty hard by Prestige 16 and that\'s about where I got stuck. After a few big updates I decided to wipe my game and try again. I\'ve been stuck on Prestige 2 and despite dozens of attempts it has been impossible to complete the runs. The gameplay just feels like it relies more and more on RNG than it did in the original Early Access drop of the game. The plethora of content makes the game feel like a wash rather than a challenge when you get a mixed bag of blueprints and non-ideal groves. The game almost feels like it leads you by the hand from loss to loss until you can somehow hobble your way to even a semblance of hope in progressing the prestiges, which makes it feel like you\'re just working for handicaps that allow you to play rather than support how you play.A lot of the positive reviews are well-deserved and true in my opinion, but I am surprised more people aren\'t disappointed in the direction the game has gone. Maybe the developers always intended for it to be as complex and difficult as it is in its current form. I cannot recommend this game because of its high difficulty upon entry, niche gameplay, and Early Access status that makes this type of game very prone to balance issues and inconsistent experience across your entire play time (just as I have experienced). I really do wish this game and studio well and will be looking forward to future games from Eremite.',''),(1867,'The core loop is fun but holy canoli it\'s repetitive af.

A nice feature of the game is that you can disable a lot of the new stuff if you want the OG experience. A lot of accessability options have been added, plus more options for changing damage taken/dealt values if you want a more chill run.Providence Trials are a new feature added in Risk of Rain Returns. They are difficult challenges that unlock skins, items and alternative abilities for your characters. Something worth mentioning is that there are alternative ways of unlocking the alternative abilities through normal gameplay, in case the challenge is too hard or you don\'t wanna bother.One thing I need to get off my chest is that the Providence Trials are all difficult, with some being frustratingly so. And if you want a Gold rating on challenges, the difficulty rating dial is turned to 11. I am not a fan of it. Some challenges I\'ll never beat and some I\'ve beaten I\'ll definitely never get Gold on. A large amount of achievements are tied to beating all challenges to unlock a special challenge, so you who seek to 100% the game will probably suffer quite a bit. That\'s it. Overall positive, if you like the original game then the remaster is worth your time.',''),(1875,'It\'s like Crack, except it\'s good for you...',''),(1876,'It\'s effectively 90% the same game as the original down to the game feel before considering the visual facelift into proper pixel art and new content and balance tweaks, with very greasy Gearbox taking up 75% of the game credits for a meager fraction of the actual work.Most of the new items entailed are essentially a curated backport of RoR2\'s actually useful ones, and Artificer is just as bad here as she was there; some things never change. The other new survivors are otherwise good, there\'s a \'that kid\' unlock process, a few more artifacts hidden around, and there are some new stage variants to shake things up a little. But there\'s no actual \'new\' stages proper, and the soundtrack is still mostly the same outside of a few cases. Still a fantastic one as ever, though it may create something of a juxtaposition with the game walking a blurred line between remaster and remake between the gameplay and visuals as-is.Whether game balance is any much better is debatable; some survivors got notable tweaks, flying enemies are far stronger, chest distribution seems to be worse, some enemies now climb ropes, many of the less useful items are still bad, and while Infusion is actually balanced with Glass active so bad players can\'t cheese it for free damage, other changes make playing that artifact more annoying than challenging. Unmodified gameplay may still result in fighting rather spongy enemies. Percentile modifiers to damage given/taken though do provide a solid alternative but will realistically be abused by many to unlock content reliably.The most notable new feature in Returns otherwise is a bunch of pre-made trials. They vary massively in difficulty and fun, rewarding more unlockable items but also notably as the method to get RoR2-style alternate skills. Sadly, many of them suffer the same problem, that by comparison to the original they\'re either a straight upgrade or so gimmicky, that they\'re basically designed around its trial.Being able to use Steamworks to host and join games with ease than having to deal with any port forwarding is a good point worth noting over the original, but sadly it\'s limited to four players until modding finds a way around that. Dead players now also become drones and have an opportunity to collect dropped items if they survive in that form.In the end, it\'s a fine re-release and it\'s still classic Risky with some welcome amenities here and there.

War is now a numbers game rather than a realtime event on the map. As long as you have full forts you\'ll probably win. As well, the commerce tools are glitched and do not work if you let your overseers decide export and import rates. For example if you want to export all surplus goods, you have to set it to specifically export over 0. Commerce is how you make money in this game so that feature being broken is unfortunate. By far the worst thing is you automatically lose if you get to -5k deben. In the original you simply could not buy anything else and had to trade and tax your way out of the hole to make a comeback.I need my regular dose of this game regardless so I have played about 50 hours and taken these changes as an extra challenge - I\'m done with the first two eras. However a significant chunk of that time must be from simply waiting for monuments to finish building for eons after I have completed the other goals, racked up enormous amounts of deben, upgraded all the living conditions as much as possible, paid my citizens 20db over the minimum wage, and gotten up to make a sandwich.

Very little has been changed from the original besides updated graphics and interface controls (and some very controversial changes to the military system), which do an excellent job of modernizing the game without losing the spirit. This update also includes the Cleopatra DLC that was originally released back in the day.If you liked the original then buying this is a no-brainer. The old 1999 game has a lot of trouble running on modern machines (especially modern monitors), and this remake takes the exact same gameplay experience and gives it a breath of new life. Some people gripe about the simplified military system, and while I personally prefer the original I definitely understand the design choice to change it. And tbh it didn\'t make that much of a difference on my experience either way.If you\'ve never played the original I still recommend it, but with the asterisk that much of the gameplay is now considered \"standard city builder\" and your enjoyment may depend on how much you like the genre. It does have a few interesting twists that still set it apart even against modern games:1) The flooding Nile, which changes season by season, refreshing the fertility of your land but also cutting off roads and parts of your city.2) The gods, who need constant affirmation through shrines and festivals because their whims can affect things like the mood of the citizenry, or the amount of flooding next year.3) The huge monuments, which are very satisfying to slowly watch come together block by block as you progress.Also, unlike most city sims, the mission levels are genuinely satisfying and well made. They do a great job of introducing and justifying new mechanics at an appropriate rate, while also stepping through the real life history of ancient Egypt.Lastly, I\'ve heard the game was pretty buggy on release but that has not been my experience so I believe most of it is fixed. I found one minor bug after a few hours of playing but I was really on the lookout for it and it didn\'t really affect anything.Long story short: good game.

This game is definitely made for a specific kind of person, but if you are in that camp it absolutely checks the right boxes that make for an excellent experience. If you\'ve played Nioh 1 or 2 you already pretty much know what to expect coming into this game with some caveats. The good: -Excellent Combat. High tier action gameplay.-Insane degrees of customization to modify your gameplay experience. There are like close to 30 playable classes and you can swap between 2 classes in the middle of combat on top of designing your own custom combos. You are constantly going to be doing pretty awesome things in combat.-Mostly great co-op experience for up to 3 players. It\'s very easy to invite your friends and can play through almost the entire campaign together, outside of a couple of instances that force you to (briefly) separate. Class design allows for players to even take on roles if you wish, such as running dedicated support , tank, or dps. Or you can ignore traditional party roles entirely. -The base game has multiple difficulty settings make the game as easy or as hard as you want it to be. Beware the optional DLC is extremely difficult post-game content. -Great levels of polish to the mechanics. There are a ton of build templates that you can create to easily swap between classes and item sets, auto-dismantle features to make the loot pinata far more manageable, auto optimizing gear for your entire party, and million other controls that the game lets you use to really fine tune your experience. The Bad: -Absolutely trash tier level design. Things start out as serviceable and become increasingly more annoying as the game progresses. Multiple layers to levels with poor visual landmarks and very little direction mean you are often going to be running around going \"Where TF do I go? Have I already been here before?\" This is made even worse by the fact that there\'s NO MAP.-This was a minor point for me, but the loot and levels progress at such an insane pace that you are basically going to just be constantly hitting the auto optimize button and calling it a day, at least until you get to the higher tier of difficulties where it starts to really matter. Your first run through the game will have a sort of disconnected feeling with the loot system where you are lacking meaningful decisions with your gear that give you a tangible impact on your gameplay.-While the story does eventually become at least coherent, the pacing is absolutely awful and it\'s really not great overall. There\'s essentially no character development to be had and the entire cast is completely one-note and forgettable.

INSERT INTO `content` VALUES (1931,'I\'m not big into WH40K or even Fantasy (soon to be Old World), but I\'ve played, both, Vermintide 2 (and 1) and Darktide and DT is finally starting to live up to the promise it was meant to deliver a year ago. If you love fast paced, sweaty, try hard action in the mold of Left 4 Dead, hack \'n slash in the grimdark world of 40K, contending with wave after wave of disease riddled Nurgle (one of the four Chaos gods and the primary antagonists of the 40K and Fantasy universe) servants, you\'re in for a treat. Currently, there are four major classes, the veteran, the psyker, the zealot and ogryn, each with a talent tree with 3 major branches, but which you can customize to a large degree by mixing and matching various skills and abilities.  All are fairly balanced, though, some may disagree to varying degrees.  There are a plethora of weapons to choose from, some of which are exclusive to the class you\'re playing (eg, force swords for psykers, club and shield for the ogryn, etc).  Most of the weapons are useful at all difficulties, though, at the highest levels, there may be a desire to lean into the \'meta\', but in regular difficulty and in most auric difficulties, the weapons are balanced enough (with a few exceptions). The in game combat is the crown jewel of the game.  The pace is fast and furious with 5 difficulty levels and an alternate difficulty called auric (with difficulty levels of only 4 and 5, but harder) as well as a mode called maelstrom which adds to regular and auric difficulties.  The music is also excellent.  Fatshark does awesome music whether it\'s here or in Vermintide 2 (and 1).  It\'s a... I don\'t know how to describe it?  Some form of industrial edm?  If that\'s your thing, the soundtrack to the game is a must. Now, all of this isn\'t w/o some warts in the game.  The game has become far more stable in the past year compared to launch as well as servers they seem to be using has caused, at least me, far fewer disconnects than before. It also lacks some QoL items that are oddly missing considering they were implemented in previous games like Vermintide 1&2; namely, keyboard shortcuts to the various stores and vendors.  The Hub is far more spread out than the Inn in VT1 or the Keep in VT2 and, yet, we are forced to run around everywhere to reach them.  You\'re also subject to the whims of rng when it comes to maps you might want to play.  Want to play a repair mission to fulfill a penance?  Too bad, what you see on the map board is what you get.  Oh, there\'s a repair mission, but it\'s only available at difficulty 1 or 2?  Or vice versa where you\'re only at 2 or 3, but it\'s available on difficulty 5? Again, too bad.The most egregious of all the warts is the itemization.  They\'ve tried to address this a few times, but it still falls far, far short.  It is rng upon rng upon rng.  The weapons have 5 categories that can add up to 380.  No category can go above 80, but certain weapons have dump stats, but you may get a hold of a 370 weapon with 80 in mobility, 80 in defense, 80 in cleave damage, 80 in finesse... and 50 in damage, arguably, the most important weapon and there\'s no correcting or getting around this.  I don\'t know how many 380 weapons I\'ve passed on or thrown away b/c, w/o the rng gods awarding you a weapon with high base stats, but base stats in the \'proper\' categories (something that changes from weapon to weapon and depending on what class is using them), a 380 weapon can be completely garbage.And... it gets worse.  You have 2 slots which are called perks.  Perks add to the weapon by giving you +dmg to a certain type of enemies or upping your crit chance or stamina, etc.  There are also 2 blessings which also add some beneficial effect to the weapon you use.  Each perk or blessing (usually) has 4 levels from, essentially, 1 star to 4 star quality.  The tricky thing is, you can alter and affix 2 of the 4 perks/blessings in any combination (ie, change both blessings, change both perks or one of each), but when you do, it locks the other 2 you didn\'t change in place.  Once you lock those other two, you can never change them again.The issue is that this is an absolutely crippling mechanism b/c the crafting process simply assigns you random perks and blessings of any level (1-4).  So, then you have to be able to find a weapon that has all the right base stats (out of 5 categories), then hope for 2 good perks, then 2 good blessings, all of which are randomly assigned when upgraded.  If any more than 2 are sub-optimal, that 380 or 375 weapon is immediately borked.  This is extremely frustrating, to say the least, when you spend tons of in game currency and resources to purchase the \'ideal\' weapon and upgrade it only for it to become garbage when you see that 2 of the perks and 1 blessing you earned on your way to a full upgrade (gray > green > blue > purple > orange) are garbage.  Remember, each perk and blessing can be 1-4 star so anything less than the ideal is kinda meh. You can earn blessings by stripping them from existing weapons or weapons earned through gameplay, but since the best blessings tend to be 4 star/tier 4, there\'s not much reason to affix anything less than 4 star perks or blessings b/c it immediately makes your weapon sub-optimal.  Not only that, if a game experiences huge balance changes just like we saw in the last few patches, you can find the weapon you spent so much time, resources and in game cash on brick over night with 0... 0 recourse to fix them. Now, if you don\'t care about that or issues with itemization or the crafting, you may find this to be one of the best games of the year.  I (and many others, I\'m guessing) find this to be a source of extreme frustration even if it\'s not a dealbreaker.Oh, one other minor point.  Unlike in Vermintide 2 where there is a huge variety in maps and landscape, the maps in Darktide are definitely cool, the sort of grimdark, futuristic hellscape/wasteland of a mega city in decline is awesome, but after a few rounds, become quite ordinary. If you can live with these warts or you don\'t care at all, all the merits I mentioned before this, the actual missions and combat, the music, the atmosphere, etc, then this is probably a game for you.

I\'ve played many farm games, some including Stardew, Story of Season games, Harvest Moon games, Rune Factory, and even other indie games like Cornucopia, and Dinkum. For single player I would recommend this game as long as you enjoy an incredible amount of grinding and semi-tedious work. For Multiplayer (which is why i initially bought it as up to 8 players multiplayer is insane and something you don\'t see often in the farming game community) I can’t recommend it. There are many things this game does right, the customization, and the whole magic system them-self is incredible, but there\'s so many little things that seeped through unchecked that you wonder how did this happen without anyone noticing.One grievance I have regardless of the way you play is how there are no sprinklers, while yes, you have magic to magically water your plants (which as far as I know we still have no way to see the grid/plants that skill will water) you will eventually have 3 farms to go back and forth to, and you are forced to farm to continue the story, which isn\'t a problem it is a farming game. However if you like to multitask, I.E farm in multiple locations you will be forced to transverse back and forth to each city and use your mana on a skill to water all your plants, every day. Sprinklers would alleviate this problem but I don\'t see them ever adding it. This issue is small in the grand scheme of things, but when you take into account the heavy reliance of magic, you can understand the frustration. Moving around quickly requires mana, but so does watering all your crops, now imagine having to water all your crops in all 3 farms and having to use mana to move around quickly. You can startt connecting the dots on how quickly you will sap ur mana, and then have to stare at your mana and will itself to recharge or take out your watering can and water your crops. There are of course items that increase your mana, but when you are playing in multiplayer (how I choose to play) you have to share these items with other players, which pigeon-holes some of your players into being the one in charge of  watering if you want to get anything other than watering your crops done. While this can be alleviated with having longer days (you can have up to 40 minute days), it is still a chore. Another minor issue I have is with the museum, there are so many things to collect (due to there being 3 different locations) but no actual checklist in-game that helps you track it. While yes it would be a QOL thing, its a QOL thing that many members of the community have wanted, and modders them self have come to fix the problem. However, I would never recommend to a person that solution to a games problem is to \"download mods.\" My main issue comes with multiplayer and the overall lack of attention and care it deserves. I am a member of their discord, and I have seen people asking for a chat notification when someone sends a message for 3 years, and we still have not received it. A modder had to take it into their own hands to create a mod that allows a notification icon to pop up, and god forbid you are on mac because that mod then doesn\'t work. it is quite frankly unforgivable in a multiplayer game to have a non functioning chat, and when asked about it many devs share the sentiment that they believe \"these players can use another software (i.e discord) to voice call\", or something of that sort. I personally have a friend that can\'t use a microphone that makes playing this game incredibly tedious as in order to chat with us he has to tab back in and out of discord in order to send a discord message, which also forces us to constantly look at discord to ensure we read his message, or else a message will go into the sunhaven text chat and be unread for minutes if not a whole play session. Another multiplayer grievance is how the story is essentially separate for everyone. The story says you need 1000 orbs to continue? Congrats everyone needs 1000 orbs each, essentially doubting the amount of grinding, mixed with the fact that there are no sprinklers to help farm in multiple locations, and you can sere how you will easily just be sleeping away your days to make it through the story for one singular person, especially when these story currency is also the same currency to actually purchase seeds to make more currency. When playing multiplayer this feels less like a cooperative game and more so a tedious single player together experience. In conclusion, for single player, if you want this game? knock yourself out, but if you\'re getting this game for its multiplayer function, I would advise against it.',''),(2008,'If you like farming community sims, you will most likely enjoy Sun Haven. There are some really nice quality of life improvements in it that I hadn\'t seen in the genre before (i.e. being able to change the length of day) and the addition of utility magic to do things like watering/mass mining/fishing etc was really exciting! I think there are definitely some things in here that will become a norm in the genre moving forward.Pros:- QoL improvements you don\'t usually see- Beautiful spritework- Music is pretty catchy, I caught myself humming along with it- Visual character customization is fantastic, a lot of species options you don\'t normally see- Lots of decoration options for your home/farm- Large variety of crops & livestock- Eating food provides permanent buffs so cooking actually has a functionCons:- Doesn\'t feel as polished as Stardew did at launch, but they\'re continuing to add content so I\'m optimistic that it will get there- I felt like you run out of dialogue with the romanceables kind of quick. That\'s probably my fault for talking to NPCs every time I saw them, which was possible since I had my days cranked up to 40 minutes a piece. But still I think a large dialogue pool would go a long way to increasing the longevity of the game.

Sun Haven isn\'t just a copy-paste of its predecessors; it\'s got its own groove.Crafting, mining, fishing, and cooking - yep, it\'s all here.

I\'ve played Star Dew Valley, Rune Factory 3 and 4... and a few others. So the question you may be having is how is this game different from those games?    *Well they are seemingly adding new content based on what others are saying.  SO it\'s still updating.    *It\'s more magical based then Star Dew... and magic has more constructive use then Rune Factory.    *Race system and race recognition.     *More RPG then Star Dew.    *Seasonal hazards. Let me explain why this is a positive not a negative... First one I encountered was the weed monster that spreads dandelions all over your farm. You can deal with him multiple ways... You can leave him be and he will leave on his one accord but that\'s boring... you can challenge him to a fun game of jump rope... you can get help in removing him from the locals... or you can leave him be and use the dandelions to level your farming skill.           There are a few other hazards I have yet to run into but that\'s an example.    Stuff it still lacks...    *As of this post, you cannot yet have children with whatever character you hook up with supposedly. But from what I hear it is in the works. Considering these are the races: Human, Elf, Angel, Demon, Elemental, Amari(beast people) and Naga... I am interested in just how much work they plan on putting into the possibilities of what your children will look like. There ARE HALF BREED NPC\'s in the game. So they could either go with your race as children or a mix of whoever you get with. which would be fun if they do that.     *Gender isn\'t a factor in character creation as of right now so they may just ask you what your gender is when the child feature comes out... I suppose that can be considered a turn off but the character models are simple enough it kinda doesn\'t matter. The only thing this would really effect is whether the child is adopted, or if your character is the father or mother.      Final thoughts: It\'s a fun game. You can play it with your friends, it\'s got a nice soundtrack... There is a lot of love poured into the making of this title. So I give it a recommend.

I have played every Monster Hunter game released in the US and this one has a ton of improvements to the basic mechanics of the game. Wirebug is great, new monsters are cool, stances are awesome, and a lot of things are going in the right directions. HOWEVER the endgame is absolute trash.Bruh before the monsters would get steadily harder and get different mechanics, or they would just add more monsters. Its why I have almost 300 hours in every monster hunter. This one I dont due to Anomolies. What they are is the exact same monsters at high level, with like 4 times the health, and red spots on them you have to target so they dont explode and one shot you. Sure you do more damage while hitting the red spots but check it, some weapons just suck at hitting them. With duals you can hit all the legs and chest spots, but some monsters you cant hit the head or tail easily. Greatsword some monsters you cant hit the spots since you have to big of a hitbox and cant be precise enough. There is no good answer for this problem and you have to be able to destroy them all or the monster explodes and kills you. Even setting aside the how annoying it is to hit a red marker on a monster with certain weapons, trying to kill monsters that are essentially super health sponges that explode is just not fun to me. Wirebugs they can keep, i even like the turret/tower defense. It gets bananas in the event quests. But just having to kill the exact same monsters that are just tankier where i have to use specific weapons for certain monsters to clear it fast solo is just a bummer.

Gerçekten oynanışından en çok keyif aldığım oyunlardan biri oldu bu oyun. Ancak benim nazarımda 2 büyük problemi var, bu problemlerden biri tamamen kişisel bir problem, benim sevmediğim ancak başka insanların sevebileceği bir sorun yani, ancak diğeri genel bir problem ve bence düzeltilmesi gerekiyor artık. İlk problemim Rampage adı verilen görev tipinde, daha önceki oyunlarda var mıydı bilmiyorum ancak World\'de böyle bir görev tipi olmadığına eminim. O kadar sıkıcı ki oyunda şu an 30 saat olmamın en büyük sebebi bu görev tipi desem yeri, çünkü yapmak istemiyorum ya. O kadar sıkıcılar ki internette bu görev tipini kaldırmanın bir yolu vs. var mı diye baktım. Bu görev tipi hiç olmasaydı ya da sadece opsiyonel olarak isteyenlerin oynayabileceği bir ek oyun modu olarak kalsaydı şu an oyunun tüm içeriğini sömürmüştüm eminim. İkinci sorun ki bence bu oyunun en büyük kusuru. Canavarların hitboxları, geliştirici ekip hiç hitboxları kesmeye uğraşmamış bile. Ne hali varsa görsünler ne de olsa hitboxlardan yakınan oyunculara \"git gud\" deyip geçiyor bizim topluluk deyip bırakmışlar öyle hitboxları. Özellikle dikey hitboxlar tam bir facia, düşmanın yerden yaptığı saldırı yukarıya da değiyor ve oyun kendi içerisinde barındırdığı wirebug mekaniğini çöpe çeviriyor. Önce wirebug\'lar ile düşman saldırılarından kaçabileceğimizi öğretip daha sonra da bu rezalet hitboxlarla yukarıya doğru kaçmanı engelliyor. Long sword kullanıyorsanız Soaring Kick/Helm Breaker yapmaya çalışırken epey can sıkıcı görüntülere maruz kalabilirsiniz bu nedenden dolayı. Çünkü dediğim gibi sizin ne kadar yükseklikte olduğunuzun pek bir önemi yok, düşmanın yerden yaptığı saldırı havadaki size değebiliyor sanki çok normal bir şeymiş gibi.MH:World\'ü 470 saat oynadım ancak o oyunda hitboxlardan hiç bu kadar yakındığımı hatırlamıyorum, hatta birkaç nokta dışında World hitboxlarından gayet memnundum ben ancak Rise bu konuda çok kötü.',''),(2041,'World is Better',''),(2042,'disappointment when compared to world',''),(2043,'The best MH game imo.',''),(2044,'I love the part where I had to hunt monsters.',''),(2045,'I dont think its a bad game... but just from playing the beginning of the game i would personally just play mhw its just better in most if not all categories (side note, i believe this game fixed and brushed up on many things within the game but its so hard to rank this game after coming from mhw which was peak, That aside the things they fixed imo in this are are as follows: give some monsters new movesets (for better or for worse) fixed mounting taking 9 years, less \"clunky combat\" even though i prefer the heavier weapons, and a pltethera of other things) But all in all it is still a monster ghunter ame and it IS still good.

Definitely buy on sale if thinking about playing.',''),(2048,'Wo Long is a fantastic game. It\'s also a flawed game. Unfortunately its flaws are almost perfectly aligned to its target audience. Hence all the mixed/negative reviews. Are they deserved? Maybe. But that\'s not the whole picture.First, the good things. Wo Long has hands down one of the best combat systems out there. That\'s not an exaggeration. Team Ninja did a very smart thing with the spirit gauge. To make you gain spirit with normal attacks and successful deflects, the game removes the usual down time where you have to wait for stamina/ki/spirit to come back. The Nioh games dealt with this problem with ki pulses and anima, but in Wo Long it feels even more fluid. You are constantly making choices in combat about how to gain spirit with attacks and deflects, or how to use your spirit for spells and martial arts. It\'s one of the most engaging back and forth combat I\'ve played.Deflection is also a very strong combat mechanic. It offers a tool that can deal with any situation. No more being chased around in the Depth by human bosses in Nioh 2, or being insta-killed by Waterfowl Dance. You can always deflect. There is an argument that it\'s too powerful, and an opposite argument that to provide challenges, the game overtuned dlc bosses. I would say this, the balance is not always perfect. But I\'d rather have deflect as a tool that I can master, than having to face situations where my only options are to run away or die.On that note, the game also has some of the best boss fights, especially human bosses. I don\'t want to spoil anything but there are at least three bosses in this game, that I would rank above all Nioh bosses and most of the Souls games\' bosses. At its best, Wo Long is probably only gonna lose to Dark Souls 3 in this regard. (Haven\'t played Bloodborne so no comment on that. Will it ever be ported to PC?) Even the more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dlc bosses are very fun to fight, if/when you learn to fight them with proper tools (spells and martial arts that can hard counter them). Another thing I find surprisingly good is how the game treated its source materials, the Three Kingdoms period. Not the novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, nor the more famous (to the Western audience at least) Dynasty Warriors games, but the actual history. The game mixed both real history events and the novelized version, changed some key characters (Lu Bu, for example) and added in fantasy elements. Somehow it created a new version of the time period that is fresh, but still somewhat true. Characterization of Cao Cao, Sun Jian and several other major historical figures are very nuanced, better than a lot of stereotypical adaptations of the same source material. The game actually prompted me to really get into that time period. And the more I learned, the more I could see and appreciate all the threads and thinking process behind the choices Team Ninja made with the story. Is it perfect story telling? Is it easily accessible to players with no knowledge of that particular historical period? No. But the story and setting do have a strong inner logic.I\'m singing praises after praises over the game. But it does have big flaws.First, the PC optimization was and is still somewhat poor. It got better after patches, but never silky smooth. And on top of that keyboard and mouse controls were broken at release.The game is shorter than the Nioh games. It suffers a bit with enemy variety. Content-wise I would put it around 80% of Nioh, which is not bad, as Nioh games are 10/10 masterpieces. But people felt shortchanged.The game has a very uneven look. Technically the graphics are not bad actually. I have no idea why people say it looks like PS3 games. If you look closely at textures and models, they are high quality. And all assets (weapons and clothing, etc.) are done with care and proper knowledge. What the game actually lacks is good overall art direction. Each map has an overpowering color filter, and most maps are covered in ugly veins everywhere. Whatever is good in the graphics is buried underneath. So sadly as a whole the game looks unimpressive.I mentioned at the beginning that these flaws were almost perfectly aligned with the target audience - the Chinese market. Take the following paragraphs with as many grains of salt as you wish. These are from my personal experiences and from reading comments online.Wo Long generated quite a buzz before release in China. Three Kingdoms is one of the most famous and exciting time period in Chinese history. And Team Ninja had a great reputation. But the majority of the Chinese gamers play on PC, unlike the rest of the world. (This was caused by a lot of factors too complicated to discuss here.) You simply could not mess up your PC port if you want good responses from this market.A huge disadvantage Wo Long had was the comparison to Nioh 2. Nioh 2 was released on PC with all three dlcs. Nioh 2 was also built on top of Nioh 1, cannibalizing most of its assets. For a lot of Nioh 2 players on PC, we encountered it as a whole package. But it didn\'t get there in a vacuum. Wo Long at release certainly felt very bare-bone if you put it side by side to Nioh 2 complete edition. This feeling of being shortchanged can be very persistent. Wo Long got many quality updates and balances since then, but it\'s hard to overcome this particular feeling. I would also say players tend to be more critical and unforgiving when the economy is not great, and games feel more expensive.Another weird thing is the story. Most people in China are actually more familiar with the novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, rather than the history. In the novel the Shu aligned characters (Liu Bei, Guan Yu, etc.) are the definitive protagonists, while the Wei, Wu and other characters are side ones. Wo Long paid a lot of attention at treating all three factions with equal attention, and aligned a lot of its story to real history instead of the novel. This actually created some dissonance to players only familiar with the novel.Personally, I\'ve waited for all the game\'s content to come out before making a final judgement. In my own opinion, the game as a whole deserves a 9, even just for its fantastic combat system. But I also enjoyed its story and even certain parts of its graphics. It\'s not perfect and not a masterpiece, but I\'m glad it got created. Wo Long opens the possibility for a better sequel that would focus on the meatiest part of the historical period, with even better systems and more variety, like how much of a giant leap Nioh 2 was compared to Nioh 1. But even without a sequel, the game can stand on its own. You get to hang out with your favorite Three Kingdoms warriors, that alone is cool.Some suggestions to make the game more enjoyable:Do not treat deflect like parry from Souls games. Use deflect like how you use dodge in Souls games. It\'s a fundamental damage mitigation, not a high risk high reward move.Try to incorporate martial arts and wizardry spells into your actions sooner rather than later. Both add so much to the complexity of the combat system.To get rid of the \"oiliness\", turn on ambient occlusion. It makes a huge difference to make skin textures look natural. It barely impacts framerates.If certain part of the map tanks your framerate, rest at a flag and quit to main menu will fix it most of the time. I think either during zone transition or when the game generates a NPC invader, the game doesn\'t dump the memory properly afterwards. Quit to main menu forces the memory to reset and the game will run smooth again.Enjoy!',''),(2049,'\" Ancient China, the story of the Three Kingdoms PeriodAnd it was adapted into a story about a monster(Youkai) outbreak. \"Affirmative+ Extreme martial arts duel (Sparring)+ Soulslike Genre+ Variety of weapons+ Variety of charactersNegative- Unfriendly and poor game system- Game specifications are poorly optimized (PC)- Extreme gameplay difficulty- Overwhelming gameplay with high-attacking weaponsIf you have patience and play consistently, the game becomes fun.========\" 고대 중국, 3국시대의 이야기 그리고 요괴 창궐하는 이야기으로 각색했다. \"긍정적인+ 극한의 무예 결투 (스파링)+ 소울라이크 장르+ 다양한 무기들+ 다양한 등장인물들부정적인- 불친절하고 열악한 게임 시스템- 게임 사양 최적화가 부실함 (PC)- 극한의 게임 플레이 난이도- 공격력이 높은 무기로 압살하는 게임 플레이인내심을 갖고, 꾸준히 플레이를 하다보면 게임은 재미가 있습니다',''),(2050,'Crashes every time I enter combat in the zone after the Boar boss.

While some may hate it, there are others who can appreciate it. I would be first in line to welcome a Nioh 3, but I can recognise Wo Long for what it is and not what people expected it to be. It is a Chinese martial arts game telling the story of the Three Kingdoms but with the unique Team Ninja spin on it. Its interesting and it is also fun if you play by the rules the game gives to you. The mechanic that you must learn is to parry, luckily the game is incredibly forgiving with the parry system, different weapons also giving even larger parry windows, the very first tutorial boss I\'d say is probably designed to teach you how to parry. It is a very simple boss to defeat if you use the parry system. I speak from experience having lost a number of times until I actually tried to understand what the game was telling me to do. As someone who has been afraid of parrying in other souls-like games I was at first hesitant to try it, but do so and you will be rewarded. The battles will open up to you in a new dimension and you will possibly see what the \"vision of combat\" is regarding Wo Long. I\'ve even taken to like parrying now and have opted to employ it in more souls-like games. So Wo Long has taught me something new and I\'ve added another skillset to my gameplay.If you enjoy that sort of thing then give Wo Long a try, don\'t let the opinions of others sway you.

It\'s dialed back some mechanics like stances, in favor of magic and weapon arts that are more like Elden Ring, so if you like Sekiro parrys and elden ring combat that\'s a lot more fast paced, but you didn\'t like the complexity of Nioh, this is probably right up your alley.

I prefer offset ideas such as Wo Long for Team Ninja to spice things up.',''),(2059,'Wo Long is a very good game, with some terrible execution. Making my way through the DLC and New Game Plus at the moment, and I figure now is a good time to give my thoughts.The moment to moment combat is pretty fun, if a little repetitive. Combat boils down to parrying enemy attacks and punishing their openings, so that you can build up your Posture gauge. With a full posture gauge, you can unleash a devastating heavy attack the decreases the enemy\'s max posture. If you break the enemy\'s posture, you can do a critical strike for massive damage. Sound familiar? This game is Team Ninja\'s take on Sekiro\'s nearly flawless gameplay loop. And honestly, they nearly nailed it! Wo Long is absolutely worth playing if you like the Nioh games and/or Sekiro. However, there are some extremely notable flaws.The performance of this game is pretty solid now, but on launch it was unplayable for anyone not running a NASA computer. Certain visual effects still grind my FPS down from 120 to single digits. It\'s not often, but it has gotten me killed during boss fights where it\'s prone to happening. Wo Long features a unique \"morale system.\" Basically, if you kill enemies and pull off critical strikes it raises your morale level. This determines how much damage enemies deal to you, and honestly I don\'t know if it affects anything else. It never feels like I do less damage if say, I have 0 morale and the enemy has 20. Seemingly the only difference is that you\'re more vulnerable to damage. This is fine on your first playthrough, where you\'re heavily encouraged to explore to find battle and marking flags which raise your minimum morale. However, on NG+ it doesn\'t carry over your flags as far as I can tell, so if you want to speed through NG+ you\'ll be EXTREMELY prone to getting one-shot. The music is pretty good, and the game can be very pretty in places, though visibility is certainly an issue. The camera is pretty janky and the brightness can get EXTREMELY dark even if you crank up the settings. Overall, this game is very very good for a first playthrough, though I wouldn\'t necessarily recommend the DLC or NG+ if you didn\'t absolutely love your time during said first playthrough.',''),(2060,'I am a massive Three Kingdoms fan.

The performance was abysmal on release. I did everything I could find online to mitigate the slow-motion and frame drops, to minimal avail. I tried to power through and got quite a ways into the game before the performance prevented me from defeating a boss. I put the game down and decided to wait for updates. The updates did not help, but I was also playing on a laptop. I decided to uninstall and return to the game once I had a desktop. FYI, this laptop can run most games without issue.Fast-forward to today. I have a high-end gaming desktop. This game has been out almost a year and, even on a whole-ass desktop with a 4070-TI, the start of the game alone is practically unplayable. I am the audience for this game. I love souls-likes, I\'m obsessed with Three Kingdoms content, and I have played through some mid-ass games just because they tell a story from this period of history, especially when they embrace the mythology.

The difficulty system in Nioh was balanced around having a decent build and a small level of mechanical mastery. This game, especially its DLC, reduces the difficulty and complexity of the game to can you parry every single hit in a 10 hit combo that comes out in two seconds? Its not fun, and if you don\'t have the reaction time to parry everything perfectly you are screwed, no way around it. I tried building my character to be tankier, but I can still only take a single combo attack. Builds are meaningless, and if you aren\'t perfect at the game than you don\'t get to progress or have fun.',''),(2062,'A worse product than Nioh and Nioh 2 in every aspect.The game suffers from:- worse graphics, animation, lighting, shadows, physics, etc. than Nioh 2- simpler combat system than the Nioh games- simpler leveling system than the Nioh games- simpler magic system than the Nioh games- bad story and cinematic storytellingIn fact, the combat left such a bad taste in my mouth, I bought Nioh 2 and thoroughly enjoyed the crap out of it. By design, Nioh and Wo Long look incredibly similar and almost identical in some regards, especially with the mission design and world-map structure. But Nioh 2, which is a 3 year older game, surpasses Wo Long in every single way. I mean, it\'s really bad when the playable character has a running animation that looks like it comes from the PS1/PS2 era. Foliage has ZERO collision physics. Lighting and shadowing are FAR worse than what\'s present in Nioh 2. I mean, it\'s quite difficult to believe this game is their latest product. I don\'t know what happened in their development process this time around, but this is a shameful product from the devs who made one of the best Action RPGs of all time. Maybe COVID affected production of the game; who knows.Either way, if you really love Nioh and Nioh 2, I wouldn\'t recommend this game because it\'ll just upset you at every turn with how low quality this entire game is.

With promises for \"more info in the coming months.\"Now it\'s November 27. Not only has the game not been updated once, not only has there not been a single piece of info, but they deleted that announcement. Instead of saying \"Hey, sorry, we misjudged our ability to finish this task in the timeframe we set for ourselves\", they pretended like that never happened.That alone is incredibly unprofessional and reason enough to never give this studio a cent. Unfortunately, in the 10 months since the game left Beta (Yes a beta before Early Access), the devs have followed pretty much the exact same path - the updates have been less and less frequent and incredibly meaningless. At best, they replace old problems with new ones. Sometimes they\'ve simply added new ones.

For starters: Boxing game yay! Finally after so long we have one again! Mechanics are very similar to Fight Night Champion but also unique enough for this game to have its own identity separated from the Fight Night series which is great. Graphics look great, boxers look great, venues, for however few there are, are pretty neat. It\'s an absolutely solid base to build upon if it\'s done right.Now why don\'t I recommend it: To be fair to both the game and the game devs being a small indie studio, they\'ve got a lot of expectation from boxing fans, almost an unfair bar to match tbh, because it has been over a decade since we\'ve had a real brass tacks boxing game. So keep that in mind. BUT, remember when I said this game is a solid base IF it\'s done right? Well right now the devs are not doing anything right as of recently. The last few major updates seem to bring back all the bugs they had previously patched out, online play is still plagued with cheaters and exploit spammers not to mention match making in general, at least in my experience, has been VERY unstable. Now I am going to take all that with a grain of salt because again, small more than likely underfunded dev studio, it\'s hard to stay on top of that I am sure, but it should still be addressed quickly and swiftly and not weeks/months in between waiting to try and patch it in with a new major update. Speaking of updates this is addressing the BIG elephant in the room, Back in September when they announced through the community hub that Custom fighters and Career mode were coming by the end of Fall 2023. Which did not happen, the community note got taken down and the devs just refused to elaborate upon as to why, they also have not provided any sort of update whatsoever as to the reason it was delayed, or when we might actually see those two very highly anticipated game modes. That is a BAD sign from any company whether it be from a small indie dev team or a triple A company. I want nothing more than to see this game and this team succeed in their endeavors but I feel as though they\'re running out of time to really impress the community and live up to bare minimum expectations. And because of that I cannot recommend this. If you are currently contemplating buying right now I would say just hold off for the time being, wait to see how it develops/if it develops, and then take a look at buying then assuming all the problems the community is highlighting are fixed.

The promise of a career mode was a major selling point for me, as I enjoy the depth and progression that career modes offer. However, the developers have pushed the update back to next year, leaving me with a game that feels incomplete and lacking in substance.Apart from the missing career mode, I have also encountered several issues with the game\'s multiplayer mode. The multiplayer experience is marred by a rampant hacking problem, with cheaters disrupting matches and ruining the competitive spirit of the game. It has become increasingly difficult to find fair and enjoyable matches online, further diminishing the game\'s appeal.In addition to these major issues, I have also found the game\'s overall gameplay to be unpolished and lacking in depth. The combat mechanics feel repetitive, and the lack of variety in game modes makes the experience feel stale.Overall, my experience with Undisputed has been disappointing.

This is it, This is the most game translation into movie quality but still a game not just a narrative with less focus on gameplay like untill dawn you will ever get.Cons:This sadly will bring in the problem of so much money and time being put into those things that the game itself suffers a bit, enemy variety is good but not great, there\'s a lot of moments the game just pads out with side quests or side content that you can ignore but by losing amazing rewards that you just really will want to have. You can\'t go back to get these quests done out of their own chapter, only after finishing the game and going through chapter select.  Some of those quests are good or at leaast decent but some were really annoying me, especially the ones around just finding cats or kids really got into my nerves.Overall it\'s a great game, but its a weird game, it\'s still very much worth playing, just be aware that it\'s not completely perfect as people might have you believe, the thing is just that while the weird padding and pacing problems from the side quest content is a downhill point for the game, everything else is so beyond all reason and extra that it brings it up on people\'s minds',''),(2090,'When i tell you this game means everything to me i mean it,Amazing Fantastic 10/10',''),(2091,'Yes, Tifa\'s abs are great--I mean the game is great',''),(2092,'I originally played this on the PS4 when it first came out.

Definitely worth the price of the current sale especially if you haven\'t played it yet.Having a ton of fun replaying my favorite game of 2020. Can\'t wait for Rebirth! Give it a go!',''),(2093,'I give this game a rank S- (95-96%)Fantastic - you need to do this game once in your life!!!See my profile for more details about my reviews.Additional notes: it is really hard for me to judge this game, and review it objectively. I actually don\'t think I can. If I made the effort to, THIS specific game, called FFVII REMAKE, would probably get a A- (85-88%). Which is honestly a great rating already, so you know what to expect. If you never played a JRPG, you can try this one without hesitation, it is very good!Okay now back to the people who KNOW the original game: unfortunately, as I said, I can\'t judge FFVII objectively anymore. Let\'s put it simply: FFVII is in my opinion the best FF of all time, and I played almost every FF since FF1 up to FF15 - the 13th is the only one I have left to do, because 11 and 14 are mmorpgs, and 16 is not out yet for me). FF7 is the best one ever on so many levels: lore, narration, story, characters, music, world, gameplay (materias), arch enemy, length, symbology, ethical messages... the list is just huge. Now, I was anxious with this one, because FF7 is one of the best games of all time for me, but at the same time it got old, it is ugly (the 3D parts mind you), clunky, slow... technology caught up. I was full of apprehension regarding what they could do to this game - I had almost 80% fear that they would ruin it, and 19% disbelief they could do anything great, just an okay RPG, differently done.... the remaining 1%, I could not believe it, but they did it: they replaced the original one. I really think now FFVII gets mashed together in my head between the original one and this one. Unless they completely mess up the 2 and 3 of this remake trilogy, if they keep the bar like this in terms of content and quality, I believe FFVII Remake/Rebirth/Rewhatever will simply replace the original one just because it is the updated, thoroughly re-established modern version of this original masterpiece. That is why I judge FFVII Remake a masterpiece, albeit a S- one, just for a few things (some weird jokes, a hard mode that is arguably problematic in terms of design - let\'s remove the items and the refill of MPs... why?), some flaws here and there. But if you played FFVII back in the day, and always wanted 25 years later to relive this masterpiece, through a new eye, with THOUSANDS of winks at you, like a love letter, so many reminiscent easter eggs, so many tributes, then you should play and enjoy this game. For the first couple of hours I was not very happy with the choice they made for the fights (real time + ultra slow pausing mode to select stuff)... now I can not help but thinking that is the best choice they could do and it is amazingly well implemented. So dynamic, so active, yet so faithful to the original turn by turn style of the old school jrpgs. Old the characters are back, and more, and if back in the day they spent X time on each, now they spend 10, 20, 50 times X on EACH character, even minor (Jesse, Biggs and Wedge! oh my god!) to give them depth, meaning, to create a layer of threads in this new narration and lore where everything makes so much more sense... just WOW. And the levels, the rooms, the graphic and illustration choices, did you see some screenshots? I spent my first run just WALKING, enjoying EACH room for the generosity of the graphics and visuals. So RICHLY done. Amazing.FF15 had started a new trend in the series I was surprisingly happy with, and now I am full of expectation for FF16, and also I can not wait for Rebirth and the 3rd opus.

Exactly what I would expect from the team behind this. However it\'s a bit of a bloated mess at times with the side quests and the layers of systems on top of each other. It does very well in calling back to FFVII but sadly I feel it lacks the charm and charisma of the original.Honestly it just feels like it\'s trying too hard to reinvent the wheel.It\'s in my opinion an okay game, a beautiful okay game, but not a great game.',''),(2095,'I just can\'t bring myself to recommend this game despite wishing I could. The dialogue, constant backtracking through levels, hours of boring filler content, stupid \"merc\" missions, poorly done backstories, and the battle system that gets old very quickly -- all make the game get old and feel so inferior to the original very quickly. I wish this had been handled similarly to the new Star Ocean Second Story remake.',''),(2096,'Tetsuya Nomura\'s stupid need to be edgy and mysterious ruins another franchise.',''),(2097,'Mixed feelings. There are some great elements here, but it\'s dragged down by some severe flaws.I liked: Graphics: they\'re amazing, mostly. (It stuttered a little at first for me, but this cleared up over the first play session.) Soundtrack: excellent. Very high production value. The way the music flows and changes between exploration and battle, and different phases of a boss battle, is very well done. One of the best dynamic music systems to date. Combat: while I still prefer classic turn-based JRPG combat, this system was quite fun most of the time. Boss battles feel truly epic, cinematics have been integrated well into the battles without compromising the gameplay. The dungeons are the highlight of the game for me. This is where the game feels most like the original. They\'re dark, atmospheric, have some light puzzles, don\'t outstay their welcome. There\'s novelty here seeing these classic characters brought to life with modern tech.I didn\'t like: The game is mostly filler. They\'ve taken the first part (Midgar) of the original FFVII and stretched it out to a full length game. The way they achieved this is packing it full of mediocre content. Tonally, it\'s kind of a mess. The thick melancholy atmosphere of the original\'s Midgar has been discarded in favor of silly action cutscenes and various wackiness. The music contributes to the issues with tone; I said the soundtrack is excellent, and it is, but the choice of music in certain areas seems inappropriate even if the songs themselves are great. If you walk into an encounter not equipped with the right materia it can be rather frustrating. You don\'t know the enemy\'s weakness ahead of time, you can\'t change your equipment within a battle, and you don\'t have enough materia to be equipped for all possibilities. The storytelling. I don\'t think you could make sense of this if you aren\'t already familiar with the story. Since it\'s a small slice of the original game, the pacing is completely messed up. There\'s no satisfying conclusion, no character arcs, not even a cliffhanger for the sequel. The plot. This added element of fate is very bad. Our characters initially are fighting a grounded conflict against an evil megacorp. Then towards the end, out of the blue, the plot suddenly switches to them fighting against \"destiny\". Why? And why do the characters accept this without question? This is obviously self-referential, with the future they are fighting to change being the plot of the original game. But the characters aren\'t supposed to know that they\'re inside of a remake. The developers seem to be using this plot element to give themselves permission to deviate from the original plot from now on, but they never needed permission in the first place. Meta elements like this in a plot almost always suck, and this is no exception.It could and should have been much better.  Still, I liked it enough to finish it at least.  Not at all excited for the sequel though, and unlike the original FFVII I doubt I\'ll ever replay this.',''),(2098,'cool game with excellent graphics and interesting plot. It\'s not difficult game.',''),(2099,'Game of the year, Rebirth come to PC faster please',''),(2100,'Play time is not reflective of my whole time playing the game. I finished with all the trophies on the PS4 version and bought this to play Intergrade. This is going to be quite lengthy so if massive walls-of-text bother you, read the review above or below mine.Final Fantasy 7 holds a beloved place in my heart as the game that really got me into JRPGs back on the first Playstation. The story was paced well, the characters were memorable, and the combat system was new and fresh to me. Keep in mind, games like Diablo 2, Twisted Metal, Age of Empires 2, and Civilization 2 were the standard I held games to at the time. When I played Final Fantasy VII at a friend\'s house I *begged* my parents for a Playstation for Christmas. They gave me one and the rest was history. I played FF7 for two years straight trying to find every little secret the game had hidden away until FF8 was released. With the background out of the way, let\'s review the remake shall we?The game\'s opening cinematic opens up and reaches the point where we see Aerith. At this exact moment, the nostalgia hits *hard*. I hadn\'t started a modern game in so long where I was this excited to dive in. The graphics blew me away. The music conjured so many memories. I felt like I was in for one of hell of a ride and this kept up all the way until the end of the opening mission. I didn\'t mind the new combat. It felt natural and still felt deep enough that it\'s not just another action game.But then the bombing mission ends. You\'re met with Sephiroth. An audible sigh escapes my lips. Since this is only supposed to cover Midgar, we shouldn\'t even *see* Sephiroth yet. We barely know his name by the end of Midgar, but okay. Expand away, I\'ll survive. Then I meet Aerith and we\'re met with the time ghost police and this is where I realize I\'m not settling in for an epic retelling of a masterpiece. I\'m about to get Kingdom Heart Nomura\'d. All pretense has dropped and I\'m no longer enjoying the game, but dreading just how much they were changing the story.I have a love/hate relationship with this game overall because of reasons already stated, but the parts that are done well and written well are genuinely phenomenal. If we could have cut out every segment that didn\'t need to be in there (Train Graveyard ghost story, Leslie story, every single side quest... sorry, side job, mechanical hand puzzle, etc.), we\'d definitely would have been able to get out of Midgar and see more of the world before part 2. There was so much excessive padding that it makes a modern Assassin\'s Creed game look tame.The ending is atrocious. I won\'t go into detail to avoid major spoilers, but Nomura has no business directing any story. Period. His creative writing skills are comparable to the absolute drivel I was writing when I was 8. All he had to do was add on to an already existing story by fleshing out the dialogue and cutscenes and it would have been perfect, but he just couldn\'t help himself. He just had to go inserting his Kingdom Hearts nonsense into a story that doesn\'t need it.With that negativity out of the way, when the game shines, it really burns bright. There were so many moments in the game where I was swept up in the nostalgia and being able to experience it with modern gaming standards. Despite loathing what they did with the story, I\'m pumped to go back with Rebirth and experience more of the incredibly phenomenal moments from the original in full HD and voice acting though I\'m sure there will be many moments where they changed events for the worse and I\'ll wince in pain.TL;DR Despite butchering the original story, the parts they did well were so well done that I highly recommend the game to fans old and new. Though if you never experienced the original, I\'d implore you to do so.

Not only is there cutscenes galore, but even regular gameplay (not to mention boss fights) is constantly interrupted by cinematics. Then there are situations where the game for no apparent reason removes your ability to run and/or forces the camera in a particular direction. It\'s less pronounced in chapters where the game gets more open-world-like, but in story missions it\'s downright terrible. So much so, in fact, that for about half of the final boss fight you\'re relegated to watching the game fight on your behalf. WTF?!Perhaps it\'s just me, but I find this so disruptive that it completely ruined the experience for me. Which is a shame because the other aspects of the game are actually really good. I like the story and the characters. The graphics are beautiful.

Even they knew what was going to happen and of course didn\'t want anything to do with it. This game is a disgrace.

This is my first battlefield game that I\'ve played since Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3, and this game doesn\'t live up to them. The game play is fun and the shooting is satisfying, but that\'s about it. The maps are boring. They\'re too open, spaced out, and there\'s no real flow to them. The destructible environments might as well not exist. The classes are also boring. The game play feels watered down because it doesn\'t feel dynamic and it just comes down to shooting. Each class has a certain special ability like all the other battlefield games, but since the game play is so fast paced and the maps are so open, they don\'t feel unique or have any real utility. Medics can be useful sometimes, but if you have decent squad mates, then they can revive you anyway regardless of their class. Also since any class can use any type of weapon, it makes the class type even more moot. Sure each class specializes in a certain weapon type and they gain certain benefits from it, but it\'s really not that big of a hindrance to use a different weapon.I can\'t really explain it, but between the poor map design, the game\'s fast paced focus (faster than what a good Battlefield game feels like), and the fading of classes, it just feels like a watered down shooter that looks like a Battlefield game, but lost touch with what a Battlefield game is suppose to be.

You start off with four members with various different types of backgrounds and then proceed to increase your party with varying types of roles, skills, and abilities as you progress. There are various types of professions which help with the creation of weapons, armors, food production, things for your party and camp, etc. These are done by small mini games that give the game a good variety in their creation. Timing can help to produce even better quality gear. You pick up quests along with random contracts given out at taverns in different towns. Managing your inventory, goods, and items are all part of the game play which feels really good. There are also a variety of different menus and skill trees to be advanced which feel really good. Each character has progression trees, the war-band themselves have trees based on how you play along with professions. This system feels very rewarding.Where the game shines is the combat. This is handled in turn based combat with movement and skills that are factored in how you maneuver your troops and execute their attacks. At the beginning of the combat you have the ability to position your war-band unless your group is surprised. From there the turns go by initiative until resolved. The animations are great and the kill cam that triggers on a great last kill always feels satisfying. I find the combat to be my favorite part of the game.I don\'t really have much in the way of negatives aside from the leveling of the professions and the level of each member of your party can get a bit slow and grindy as you get higher levels giving the feeling of a very slow progression. Aside from that, this is an absolute gem of a game worth every penny. I eagerly look forward to any further DLCs or expansions that may be in Wartales future.

I thought this game seemed like the ideal way to live out that lifestyle: A turn-based, survival, open world, management, rpg featuring aspects of economy, thievery, camp life, bounty hunting, prisoner taking, animal befriending, choice making, and bad-guy stabbing.

My hat\'s off.',''),(2153,'I almost never post reviews, but I wanted to like this game enough that I\'m going to. Can\'t recommend this game at the time of this review. Things wrong with it:1) Pathing. You want your group to cross a mountain ridge? Need to do it manually. If the option for smart pathing exists then it\'s not enabled out of the box. Which is ♥♥♥♥. You say I\'m being too harsh? No. Because this problem exists not only for global pathing but local pathing too. Why do I get stuck on terrain when the destination is literally a few meters away from me? You also can\'t just travel across a town even when there\'s a road going right through it. That means if you want to catch a merchant caravan before it disappears in town, you need to path around the town. I can not think of any sane reason for this design and attribute it to the laziness of the devs.2) Oh you say it\'s fine, manual is good, it\'s old-school, it\'s more authentic, unlike that hand-holding BS in modern games... I don\'t buy that but if that\'s the argument then at least allow fast forwarding. I\'m not even asking for unfair travel speeds where you can always run away from danger or something. Just let me get to the destination faster. Of the hours I played the game, most of it was spent walking back and forth. If you like a walking simulator, buy this now and never look back.3) Combat isn\'t well thought out. Difficulty should come from tactical elements and not things you cannot do anything about. Some civilian will light your well-armoured military unit on fire who takes 15% max hp damage every time he ends turn and the only way to put it out is from movement abilities that most of your guys probably won\'t have. Is that fun? No. Oh by the way, did I mention the core mechanism in the game for melee units is you \"engage\" an enemy by attacking them in melee range, thereby locking you in combat? And to debuff them you can \"surround\" them by having multiple melee units adjacent to them. But that means civilians are very high threat because they can light all surrounding units on fire. Yea, no.4) Resources. Iron ore node respawn is 15 in-game days or something ridiculous like that. ♥♥♥♥ that. Not many merchants will sell it either.5) Choices for relationship issue resolution make no sense. What\'s the point if the relationship will deteriorate regardless unless you sack one of the units? This makes the game \"hard\" sure, but not in a fun way. For context, I took a gamble with my archer and she hit a teammate. Next rest, the teammate wanted her gone. Best option was to ask the teammate to drink it away but it required a beer, which I can\'t find anywhere but many wines are readily found.6) The scaling that everyone complains about is there and yes it\'s bad. The enemy group sizes grow as you recruit more people, but the drops don\'t seem to scale. I killed a whole group of 9 guards and walked away with a spiked club, and 100 suspicion level which costs 200 gold to clear. Ok so crime doesn\'t pay, got it. But I fought a similarly sized group of bandits and also came away with scraps. So the game disincentivizes fights. Why even play then?These are the main issues and I\'m only a few hours in. Save your money and buy only on sale for $10 or something. At the current price I can\'t recommend it.',''),(2154,'- Great combat, that rewards tactical positioning and aggressiveness- Morale meter that allows you to end combat early when you obviously have won (e.g. only 2 enemies left compared to your full party).

The game is largely polished. I have encountered few frustrating bugs, but I believe they have been fixed by the active Dev team. Overall, it is great worth for money and lets you have epic-scale arguments with your pals on who goes first during the fight.Final rating - ★★★★★  Follow Vaporlair for more reliable recommendations! Experience (gameplay/lore) -You lead a band of mercenaries - starting with four members of the group and a pony. With all of them being equipped in low quality weaponry and armours - and with rather serious chances of dying during first encounters - you struggle up, completing missions, leveling up, getting better gear and gathering resources off the map to grow your camp. There currently are 10 professions your novice mercenaries might choose from - with levels ranging from novice to master. These are going to be majorly useful on your way, allowing you to craft superior gear, medicine, torches and otherwise - gain knowledge points necessary to advance and upgrade your mercenary team. Lore is pleasantly designed: giving you unobvious choices to make, taking you through lands experiencing refugee influx, pestilence - and so on, so on. It\'s not that easy to take a side and you\'re likely rethink some decisions.Audiovisuals (graphics/audio) -Wartales is pretty. It\'s how you\'d like your Mount & Blade 2 to be, in fact. You\'ll find yourself, I\'m sure, rather happy with how locations are designed. Interiors of places - towns, shops, points of interest - are pleasantly arranged and furnished, great outdoors are full of trees, shaped coastlines, terrain of different height and bodies of water. Companions do have few customisation options, all the clothing changes are reflected as well.The music is fine. It\'s not very memorable; the award here should go to sound effects - noises, groans, moans, weapon effects hearable during attacks - that\'s really well-designed and makes you in awe of all the combos, critical strikes and choice of weaponry!Optimisation (mechanics/bugs) -Wartales is well-optimised. Actually, I am surprised with how small in size this game is and how fast it works even on mid-tier PCs. Loading screens before combats are short, you can load your game really swiftly. Combat restarts can be done without disconnections on co-op and are also rather quick.I\'ve had some issues with troops passing through places they shouldn\'t, disconnecting my group on co-op and forcing us to reload; I\'ve had bugs disallowing my folks to pick up the loot and customise their characters in initial menu. Fortunately, they were single occurrences and some of them, allegedly, have been fixed - hence, I don\'t have much to complain about.TAGS:#rpg #strategy #coop',''),(2157,'This is an odd one... The game has solid foundation but i feel that its ultimately held back due to questionable design choices.I was writing a proper review in the reasons why but i noticed i ended up writing an article pointing the flaws in game design.So the TLDR: You are punished by doing well. You are punished by leveling up too fast because your equipment doesnt have time to catch up to your levels.(You end up being lvl 8 with half your team using stuff for level 3-4 or worse if your team is big)Somehow they managed to punish efficiently grinding in a VERY grindy game. They punish you for taking people with perks that earn extra exp because they will get ahead of the team and make the enemies higher level while your team didnt catch up to the levels. ALSO the enemies will drop items that have higher level requirement that your team cannot use. ALSO you will have less time fighting enemies in a certain level meaning you have less loot, meaning you will have less options to equip your team with. ALSO the enemy teams gets bigger as your team gets more people... but the loot doesnt increase. So the bigger your team less rewarding is the fights.Like i said there is very odd gamedesign decisions in a pretty solid game, at first its not a big issue but after some time in the play-through the issues gets more and more glaring. I restarted my runs multiple times trying to understand what was going on and messing with game settings but sadly its simply design flaws holding this game back.Theres \"solutions\" for these flaws, you game the system. EG: You leave your high level characters in a town and leave with a smaller team of lower level characters. So the enemy groups get smaller and lower level, allowing for easier fights and more chance to get loot of your proper level.I mean... at this point you are taking the flaw in the design and taking advantage of it to make the flaw less relevant.And the devs? WELL.... This game is on gamepass. The version of PC on gamepass is ERASING SAVES for sometime now.The devs announced a DLC. That shows how much the devs care about the player experience.',''),(2158,'I can\'t recommend this game. There will be some spoilers in this review.I like games where you are controlling tiny guys on the screen and part of this game has that. It wasn\'t particularly compelling, but good enough. I also like turn based combat- again this game wasn\'t particularly compelling but good enough. There is some resource management- your soldiers can be miners, scholars, tinkers, etc. and there is some mini-game like features associated with crafting... that isn\'t particularly compelling but good enough. Just about the whole game is good enough but nothing special.Then, for some reason, when you get to the fifth zone this very, very low magic world introduces zombies.It calls them plague victims, but they\'re really zombies. I could deal with that, but it also introduces new game play features which amounts to being good at running away. There are encounters where your job is to run away because the zomb... plague victims will spawn endlessly. If your guys, which you\'ve spent hours developing as tough, stout fighters aren\'t fast enough they will die. I couldn\'t stand it.I\'m sure some people will like this game, it\'s gotten very good reviews. If not for the run away encounters it\'s very likely I would\'ve finished this game because it was a competent game that was good enough, but mainly because I don\'t have anything else to play. I\'m not going to ask for a refund or anything. Up until Luden I was happy to keep playing.

The game masterfully balances challenge with progression, delivering an experience both rigorous and rewarding. I really don\'t know why it took me as long as it did to buy it. Fans of management, turn-based strategy, and \'Witcher\'-like fantasy settings will enjoy this.',''),(2162,'I actually used to really like this game. I was in fact fairly close to the end of it when they announced the new dlc so I decided to wait until it came out to buy it and play through the rest of the game.     Unfortunately a balance patch that released with said dlc killed the game for me. What was a quick and brutal tactical game has just turned into a tedious slog to play, with every fight taking twice as long as it should. I ended up just dreading each fight because I knew it was going to take too long and I would be struggling with the games completely arbitrary starting positions in every combat. Goes to show how little changes can massively impact the experiences of the people actually engaging with the mechanics. What may have been an improvement for some was an unexpected and unwelcome change for me. So the game was more than the sum of it\'s parts before it start to break down, early on it\'s quite good when money is tight and you actually have to be a little careful but quickly the numbers of units on both sides balloons to be unwieldy and to bog the game down. Quite literally in combats case because it seems like half of you units always start in the mud and the rest are on the other side of the map.      The management system is interesting, you camp set up is important as your characters will develop relationships with other characters based on proximity in camp and their activities in combat and will also play a big part in your ability to keep prisoners from running away. You research and unlock new items and upgrades for your camp and different terrains provide different activities for your mercenaries to perform overnight to gather resources and raise their skills. Sadly I found most of the management side of the game to be over and done with about half way through my play time with every item unlocked and upgraded and food and money easy to obtain.The combat is the bulk of the game and each of your mercenaries has skills based on their weapon and class, with the selection ranging from great, to pretty niche, to just bad with there being times when levelling where I was faced with the choice between three skills or upgrades that would never get used. Visually while the dark fantasy aesthetic looks nice there is little variation in armour so your mercenaries tend to all look the same, compounded by the lack of interesting choice between weapon skills and class meaning that most of your mercs of the same class will be filling the same role and using the same equipment. I found myself having certain characters using inferior helmets just to be able to tell them apart. The basics of combat is that each mercenary has their move of their basic attack and pretty much everything else will cost you action points to use which come from a pool that the entire group draws from consisting of two types, permanent points which are gained by sleeping and regenerate each day and temporary points which you gain in combat through various actions based on your class skill tree like engaging enemies in melee combat or killing enemies. The order of combat is initiative based and being hit is costly because each damaged piece of armour or wound will need to be healed so you are very much encouraged to pin down or kill every enemy before they can do anything to you and when it works it\'s gloriously fun and brutal. But the  problem is that there are a few factors that really drag the experience down. The first is the way that positioning is done at the start of combat, with a number of slots that your mercs and ponies to fill just arbitrarily scattered around the place so you most likely will end up having to split your forces because you didn\'t have enough slots to actually set them up the way you wanted. The then there is the mud, which is an obstacle on almost every battle field and for some reason half the starting positions are in the mud. So you end up on the other side of the battle field and moving slowly from the mud. Up until recently I could mitigate this problem turning what is a major frustration into an minor annoyance but this has been changed requiring more units. The main problem being that the combat really starts to be a slog when you have more units. i find what was fast paced brutal fun becomes slow and tedious and that fails to match the pacing of the rest of the game, travel is only slow at the start very quickly becoming fast paced, management is really quick, arenas are quick, exploration is quick and my favourite aspect of the game. The other big issue that mars combat is that fact that the maps are not interesting in the slightest and you will see the same ones a lot, with most consisting of some mud scattered about. The set piece fights are so much better than most of the rest with interesting mechanics and situations, except for any of the ones where you have to run away from something which then comes back to dealing with the movement problems of other combats.   The exploration deserves a special mention because it\'s the aspect of the game that really shines. On the over world map you can set up new paths using pitons and ropes and the actual act of moving about the map is mostly well done though it does suffer from some pathing problems. The exploration of the tombs is a great little dungeon crawl with some easy puzzles and fighting monsters in the dark shakes up the combat and each one was a nice side diversion that ties really well into the research system.     Overall the pacing of turn based combat is a difficult thing to pull off and can often be quite subjective but in this case the tactics are not in-depth enough for me to want to spend that much time in each individual fight considering I am going to be fighting hundreds of times. Before the pace was pretty good for me when using a particular set up but now  to get the same pace in combat I need more units which means more food and more gold which slows down the pace of the other aspects of the game. It\'s a balancing act between all of them that doesn\'t work for me anymore.',''),(2163,'An impressive and ambitious game that expertly blends strategic RPG elements with turn-based tactics. What really impressed me was the game\'s tactical depth and the importance of positioning in battles.

The game\'s world is rich and detailed, with each region having its own challenges and stories, adding depth to the experience.However, the pace of the game can sometimes feel slow, especially due to the extensive walking and long battles.

It takes a while to get used to the balance of the game, but once you are ready this is very enjoyable and definitely worth a shot.One of the most enjoyable aspects of explroring in the game is how enemy AI functions and how the world flows into different areas to form one big landscape.You will grind several things here, materials to upgrade the city, stats for your Digimon, tamer rank by walking/collecting/fighting, food ingredients and money. The main obstacles will be stats and materials to upgrade the city.

Both are now 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn\'t beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work.

It promises a delicious and intriguing adventure, proves to you that it indeed can fulfill this promise - and then it just kinds of... trails off into mediocrity.Okay, mediocrity is a bit of a strong word. The game still manages to be very engaging, and the way it channels the spirit of Lovecraft\'s... uh... craft - a nice surprise, considering how often \"Lovecraftian\" is just a shorthand for tentacled cosmic horrors. But that only strengthens the burning question I\'m left with after beating it: what if?Sunrise over Innsmouth the MarrowsSee, DREDGE has a very strong start. Something\'s not right. You know something is going to happen. Fishing? Sure, let\'s fish, sell the fish, get better gear. Don\'t pay attention to the black ooze coming from the package you\'re asked to deliver. And make sure to come back before sundown.Point is: the mood is there. On top of it, you\'re given a nice gameplay loop with an extensive upgrade tree. Oh yeah. This is going to be a great ride. Eventually, you begin the main quest in the earnest, and things really get moving.A leak in the hullBut then you slowly start noticing the flaws. The pacing is not quite right, for example. When upgrading my boat, I often felt constrained in this... artificial way. Almost like I\'m just supposed to do things in a specific way. This one\'s a bit hard to explain, and maybe it\'s a me problem; who knows. Another artificial feeling comes when you realise how the game world is structured. It feels less like a living, breathing world, and more like, well, a set of video game levels. Everything is too deliberate; too functional. You might say that it\'s a good thing, keeps things lean. I say it\'s a tradeoff - one I personally didn\'t like too much.Light up the nightAnd the final complaint is that once you begin the main quest, the dread just stops. Yes, there is the general feeling of \'what the hell am I even working towards\' which keeps going until the very end, but that\'s about it. The areas start feeling sterile. The threats - all manageable with ease. Even the night stops being an issue after a while.Also, the general design of the areas other than the central one is just... not very eldritch, if that makes any sense? There\'s nothing ominous about them. Yes, there are major, location-specific threats, but they\'re rather obvious and have some pretty fool-proof ways of neutralising. Maybe it\'s my fault for comparing this game in my mind to Sunless Sea (can you blame me?), where literally every place filled you with a dread of different flavour (even if the gameplay itself was nowhere near as fun as here).Rise from the depthsYeah, the game is fun, in spite of all these flaws. Fishing might be a collection of minigames, but they\'re varied and short. The inventory management is a pleasure throughout the entire game. And even though I said that the threats are all trivial to manage, it still remains a thrill to do so - mainly because your boat is very susceptible to damage, and every hit can ruin your haul.And the main mystery, hoo boy. You\'re being fed pieces of the truth as you go, and let me tell you: I\'ve seen a lot of mysteries. I hate the extent of my plot prediction abilities. And here? I managed to piece one thing together, but the final twist caught me off guard like a champ. And it\'s excellently foreshadowed. Throw me backI guess I just wanted... more. More mystery. More exploring. More upgrades. It\'s a great game, all things considered; and the combination of fishing and Lovecraft seems like such a natural concept. And yes, in spite of everything I wrote, I recommend this game wholeheartedly - even if, or perhaps especially if you\'re not very good with horror.And for those who don\'t generally play indie titles - thanks for reading. DREDGE is a good game, but trust me, if you decide to, uh, dredge the depths of the Ocean of Steam, there are so many amazing experiences out there to find. For sure, play this one; just perhaps consider throwing your fishing line into the unknown sometime. You\'ll be very surprised by what you\'ll find.Curator page',''),(2234,'DREDGE is a neatly packaged game.Its scope is strongly defined, its aesthetic is consistent, and its gameplay is well-realised.You find yourself in Little Marrow after crashing your ship into the rocks that flank the town, indebted - both metaphorically and financially - to the townsfolk who rescued you. What follows is a dozen hours of fishing mini-games, inventory management, and exploration, guided by the game\'s story - an understated, mysterious, lovecraftian tale of tragedy, which is intriguing if a little conventional.The gameplay is enjoyable enough but doesn\'t take long to become a repetitive task, though checking off the list of sea-dwellers in the encyclopedia is satisfying. Each creature has one or more aberrational variants - a manifestation of the eldritch forces that loom over the world - and further variety is added through the different biomes, requirements for catching specific fish, and how well you are able to maintain your sanity in the wake of witnessing otherworldly abominations.Creaking pontoons, clacking winches, and swelling waves help deliver the atmosphere of the game effortlessly, along with the often serene and occasionally unsettling score. Depictions of strange fish reveal the unspeakable terrors from the deep: voids where eyes should be, blistered and bubbling scales, and grotesque many-mouthed beasts.On a technical level the game performs wonderfully. It\'s evident that the resources required aren\'t anything remarkable but it\'s still nice to see such a smooth experience. I played on Steam Deck mostly, with a little time spent on PC, and never ran into any issues. Despite Steam telling me otherwise, the game worked perfectly with a DualSense controller and displayed the correct button prompts.Though the majority of your time is spent engaging with \'cosy\' gameplay mechanics, they coalesce effortlessly with the horror aspects to deliver a rewarding experience that makes DREDGE a game well worth playing.',''),(2235,'The fishing mechanic, which the entire game seems to be based around, doesn\'t land with me. It feels like an overpriced mobile game.',''),(2236,'This game is somewhat difficult to recommend simply because I\'m not sure what it offers. At it\'s core it\'s got a nice idea, playing as a fisherman in a lovecraft story. However the characters are very thin and the story is somewhat minimal, so you aren\'t going to get any deep conversations or meaningful themes.Perhaps gameplay? It\'s a good game to play in the background, but for a creeping dread horror game that\'s not a strong endorsement. I thought it was going to be scary in a \"Is that just a trick of the light, or did that shadow just move?\" kind of way. As your paranoia meter goes up, more spooky things start happening to you, but this already shows a fundamental misunderstanding, Now there\'s a clear line between I am in danger and I am not in danger. Spoiler: If your paranoia meter isn\'t flashing red, you\'re not in danger. Any potential danger outside of this is very easy to spot.\"But it\'s an adventure game\" There\'s 5 locations in the base game each with a minor gimmick and a few fetch quests.I don\'t understand why this game is overwhelmingly positive. It\'s alright, it\'s not a bad game. On a sale I\'d even recommend it, but as it stands the game is just kind of mediocre. The game has a lot of potential but squanders it with a lack of character, intellectual meat, or quest variety.Additional Note for the Devs: If you\'re going to add an enemy that resembles another boat, have there be other ships that we can mistake it for. As it stands, I can see it from distance and cleanly avoid it.',''),(2237,'Why are DLC achievements stopping me from getting 100%. Bad game design, sorry can\'t recommend.',''),(2238,'I wish there were a \"aight\" review option because this game does atmosphere really well, but I feel like it doesn\'t do characters or events much justice. Level design was mostly innocent, but also felt goofy at times just from the nature of the way I explore games.I\'d say, if you want to play a fishing game with great lovecraft atmosphere, then this would be a huge recommend, but I was here for some lovecraftian horror and storytelling that I feel fell short.I would have really liked some characters to have more dialogue after their pursuits/quests are complete. It really feels like someone asks something of you, you do it and then nothing happens. I don\'t think this is excused by the whole \"Horrors beyond comprehension\" trope either as EARLY QUEST SPOILERS:  literally nothing happens when the fish market is given an aberration to eat. He just closes for a couple days and then pretends it didn\'t happen. Similar with the dock worker. Dude apparently just placed an order for a horror beyond his reading level and then stands there for the rest of the game as a pale zombie. Maybe the game just isn\'t exactly for me as I believe the appeal of being a fisherman is meant to be as present a selling point as the eldritch horror. It would hurt the fishing catalogers to suddenly and without waning have important NPCs lose their minds from staring at a rock too long,  but I still feel that a lot of the horror could be expanded on conceptually and fleshed out like the end of the main story pursuit is which was really cool!The ice DLC is good except for the weird entrance to the iceberg. which felt... idk too artificial?The key DLC is garbage though. I don\'t have a problem with supporting devs for making a sick game, but the workshop that the key unlocks is visible for 98% of the game and nothing tells the player that they need a DLC they don\'t have in order to open it. I don\'t think I should have the option to inspect the workshop if I don\'t own the DLC personally.',''),(2239,'Bought it for the overwhelmingly postivie reviews, and I really don\'t see it. Every area is barebones, generally with a single NPC to talk to (not including the same shopkeeper in every area), who needs a specific fish for some reason and then you get a small powerup like fast travel or fishing really fast for a bit. They should remove the lovecraftian tag because there\'s pretty much no horror in the game at all. The scariest thing that can happen is a large snake thing chasing you. None of the NPCs seem to care, and the spooky lovecrafting powers are just  random game tools like fast travel or a speed boost. It\'s very hard for anyone to take it as a mysterious otherworldly power when it\'s just the equivalent of stepping on the accelerator.Most NPCs have no interaction after the first time you talk to them. There\'s a point in the game where you have to help an NPC called The builder make a house and then take them there. At which point you never say anything new. Most NPCs are in the first 2 areas after which you\'ll won\'t even find more than 1 per zone.Every quest is a fetch quest and all of them are convuluted reasons for which someone wants a particular fish. Even then, it can be nonsensical. There\'s a quest to give a certain fish to a robed cult members and the reward is a boost to your engine. This feels more like a mobile game that people can play on the side while doing something else.',''),(2240,'We do a little summoning.',''),(2241,'When I sat down to play DREDGE, I was expecting a lax, calming game about sailing the seas and harvesting some fish. Sure, the \"Lovecraftian\" tag tipped me off a little, but I was sure that my innate fear of the ocean would keep me plenty entertained.What I was NOT expecting was to walk away with DREDGE as one of my favourite games of the year in a year that has been jam-packed with amazing releases.Seriously, this game does everything you\'d want a game of this genre to do. It delivers on the fishing, it delivers on the world, the characters, the immersion and... well, that tag isn\'t there for no reason. In fact, it was so good that I was immediately compelled to go for 100% right after seeing the credits.As for gameplay, it goes for a bizarre blend of a fishing minigame that you might find in a game like Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing, but it manages to sprinkle in one of the most ingenious elements from a game like Don\'t Starve: the Sanity (panic) meter. Trust me, you\'ll get used to frantically glaring at the surface of the water while that chromatic aberration kicks in.The upgrade system helps you feel like you\'re truly progressing, and something that I cannot commend the game enough for is the freedom of choice. Do you want to brave the waters on the first night, slowly dredging while something larger-than-life waits beneath? Go ahead. Want to take your time, upgrading your ship as much as you can before entering a single major area? You can do that, too.I CANNOT recommend this game enough if you\'re into this sort of \"subtle horror\" experience. If you\'re like me and are helplessly scared of any body of water that\'s more than two-feet deep, then all the better.Definitely one of the standouts of the year, and one that I\'ll look back on fondly.',''),(2242,'Crab pots.

Player character exists only in the Narrative. No early obvious way of increasing Army size.Maybe I need to play longer to see some of this, but can\'t really recommend this game.Edit: Played a bit more. And basically agree with my earlier review.The game really needs a few more RNG features for world generation.  Always start out with the same army of goblins and then whatever familar based on my Crafting Choices. Always get the same Apprentice multiple turns in, always have the exact same fights to reclaim the reserarch. The map might change if I pick a different map out of the choices of 5, but beyond that way to much is static.The AI is also just wierd.

I get that they are not suppose to be treating you as an equal. But the AI interactions, seem incredibly limit, and one sided. You can initate doing favours for them. You can give them all-fire sources out of a desire to appears them. I get your suppose to be insignificate, but some of them do have small amount of quests, and are willing to ask you to do things, but that only seems to slightly delays the inevitable fact that you have to go to war with them.

T_T After you lose like that it really makes you wanna give it another shot.   This game have a lot of very cool mechanics. Crafting is VERY good. Unit customization is the best I\'ve seen.  You can get a unit that can enslave other mobs. You can make armies on the fly with summons. You can terraform the map or give your armies ability to fly. There are RPG quests, artifacts, runes that give you new abilities. The game pace is a bit slow but building your armies feels rewarding. You can move your mage tower! In fact you should do that often. The other mages get more and more upset with you since you keep messing around with glowy magic holes and it\'s all fun and games untill titan shows up. You can find more magic book pages and research some neat spells.I like it. The concept is unusual but it works. Might take you a couple of starts to figure out how to play though.',''),(2252,'This is not a bad game, not really. But most things are so lazily done that I just cannot recommend it.Take the quests, for instance. The game is centered around them, but the developer originally didnt provide any way to track them. Now, eight months after release, they released a patch with \"quest overview\" that only shows you a location, but doesnt tell you what you are supposed to do there. Would it be so hard to include the original dialogue or a one-sentence summary of the quest? Seriously, this half-baked nothing took eight months?The UI is another sore point, many things could be communicated much better. The battles are OK, but again, many things could have been clearer, including where your units can and cannot move.I loved the third Spellforce installment and played through all the DLCs, but this is just disappointing.',''),(2253,'This game was definitely not ready to be released. These developers are beyond lazy and released a game with where the primary focus is relying on completing quests (outside of defeating the other mages). In their infinite wisdom they chose to not create a quest tracker, so your basically running around the map and generating quests and it doesn\'t tell you how to complete them and sometimes doesn\'t even show you where to go to complete the quest.',''),(2254,'Great game, pity it has no voice overs, but therefore the price is much lower than your typical game. Love the Spellforce lore',''),(2255,'This game is truly awesome. To me, it\'s like Heroes of Might and Magic IV brought to a new height, in the sense that you get to plan and customize your troops much more, and there is a significant sense of progressions for your force. With crafting, spells on units, leveling units, ... it feels like an awesome combination to me. To me it\'s the best game among the dozens of games I find and play in 2023. Maybe a reason that the review isn\'t overwhelmingly positive is that the combat system is kind of deep, creating some barrier for players to enjoy it. And yeah, that can be an issue or a superb advantage, depending on what we look for.',''),(2256,'I was really conflicted about whether to recommend this game, but in the end it\'s a no.  It\'s very beautiful but the game balance is frustrating.  At a basic level the problem is that hidden information makes it difficult to complete a level until you take several tries at it, but when you DO finally do so it\'s fairly straightforward to get all the animals, all the bonus achievements, etc.  For example, in the first biome, you only find out you\'ll have to pick up all your equipment by riverboat once you\'ve completed basically everything else- and the best time to build new riverbeds is in the first stage of terraforming.  This feels really unfair, like fake difficulty.  It some ways it\'s just a matter of framing- the surprise in the 4th environment felt perfectly fair (it tells you there\'s seismic instability but doesn\'t tell you the consequences until you inevitably trigger it).  But framing matters, or we\'d just be playing a puzzle game with colored blocks.  If it was easier to barely scrape by on your 1st or 2nd try, but could take a dozen or more tries and very careful planning to create all the micro-biomes needed to 100%, then I could recommend this game without reservation.  As it is there\'s too much frustration up front, and too little replay value afterwards.',''),(2257,'This was a fun little teraforming game. I enjoyed the environmental renewal concept, it mixed well with bringing back ecology into a ruined planet. I do wish the game was longer (it only took me a few hours to complete) but it was a well thought out and complete game. My main complaint about the gameplay was being unable to move things after placing them, occasionally I would place something without thinking and would have to start the whole level over. It was kind of annoying.Final comment: I agree with previous posts $25 is too much for such a short game. Wait for it to go on sale.',''),(2258,'I recommend this game, with a specific reservation. I\'ve read some of the negative reviews, and I agree with their sentiment but not their reasoning. I have no idea how I heard about this game, but I was more excited about Terra Nil than even some of the big games this year. A little puzzle builder, with a unique premise and really good presentation. It just scratched a little niche itch for me, and I was eager to give it a try.I opened it up on launch day, and dove in. The art and sound design were great, and the difficulty was surprisingly challenging for such a chill game. You have to learn how to set yourself up, and each biome has a really unique set of challenges. And then once I beat the game, watched the credits roll and sat back... I returned to the same earth I started on, and it just didn\'t feel satisfying. Did I want to play longer? Maybe, but it\'s not like Journey was a rip off given the ratio of playtime to dollars spent. Going to a movie can cost the same and lasts much shorter. This is the sentiment I saw in reviews - people finishing the game and wanting something... more.In reflection, I think the issue is that this game promises a chance to save the environment. But you get to the end, and close the game and real life floods back in and it\'s just... not any better, really. Earth is fundamentally the same, and my hard work didn\'t make a dent. I recommend you play this game. Enjoy your time with it. Things can get better for a little while, even if only virtually.

It has the scope of a demo.',''),(2260,'The visuals are very pretty and I enjoyed the combination of building and puzzling aspects. I liked the concept of building up healthy nature from a wasteland and then leaving no trace after completion. For me it was a very chill building game with some light puzzle elements.That said, at least on medium difficulty, the actual puzzle was often not particularly challenging and even once I \"got\" it it still took a fair bit of time to go through the motions of actually completing the levels. I didn\'t mind so much because of the beautfil visuals. Speaking of levels: As of the time of this review this game has eight levels in four different worlds, each with slightly different mechanics. Considering the price this feels very light on content.I bought this game on sale and enjoyed my time with it. I don\'t think I\'d recommend it at full price. I also encountered a bug where the game automatically selected a vertical resolution and didn\'t display the in-game handbook. So that was confusing at first, but adjusting the resolution also fixed the issue of the invisible handbook.',''),(2261,'This game had so much potential.

The atmosphere is pleasant, but I don\'t think it\'s worth such a price for so little.',''),(2263,'As other have said, it falls short of being excellent; the mechanics are good, not excellent. There is NO story. There is no plot, or motive other than depolluting the landscape. There isn\'t an explanation on why some things happen the way they do.I found the lack of meaning to really detract from the main idea - why was the world ruined? Who are you even, and why are you teraforming the world back? How do the animals just return from the branches and trees? So basically finishing each map and ultimately the game without the story feels like... just completing a game. I lacks the sense of awe that should come with a world blooming back - or a sense of tragedy and loss from the ruined landscapes and ghost towns. It is unfortunate what potential was lost ultimately.',''),(2264,'I actually really like the idea of this game, and most of the gameplay. It\'s just the \"pack up and get off the map\" phase that\'s extremely frustrating. First you have to place the recycling units within range of the buildings, and then you have to place the beacons on waterways to summon your drone (which is a little boat that always get stuck and your only hope of un-stucking it is to exit and then re-enter the game) to collect the recycling units (which might be out of range of the drones in which case you need to build a turbine in order to build an excavator in order to build a canal which might also need to have water pumped to it in which case you need to build a pump too. And then all these have to be recycled). I\'m glad the game factors in cleaning up your stuff but the terrible gameplay mechanics of this phase just make it infuriating and un-necessarily time consuming. Maybe the ship could just, y\'know, collect all the recycling silos you\'ve built as it flies out?',''),(2265,'it\'s really cute and fun. i wish there were more continents to clean up, though. according to the progress, i\'m already halfway through, but i doubt there are any more at this point^^ still a good game.',''),(2266,'Tried the demo and had hoped for something more advanced in the full release.

But there are way too many annoyances to let this game feel great. It IS a beautiful game, with a beautiful message and all that good stuff. But for the sake of brevity I will only point out the shortcomings.Too long/Didn\'t readImmersion-breaking bugs, lack of clear information on goals and counter-intuitive area progression took away that feeling of satisfaction when playing this game. It could have been great, but felt unpolished and unfinished.BugsWhile at first the game is spotless, the mechanics added in later levels, such as letting you move your buildings, will often break.In my playthrough, I could not get grass to grow in a square that was previously occupied by a building I moved before. It even allowed me to try and move that \"building ghost\" a second time, even though that building was not even visible anymore, only to have the mover drone stuck in place, forever trying to place something that didn\'t exist anymore, locking down resources.Marked areas, such as animal scanned zones and powered tiles will often linger around after you have deselected them, leaving a blank area highlighted for no reason.UIThe presented information is frequently unclear.Let\'s say you want to scan and find an animal. This one having two requirements. The animal location hint says it is in an area with ocean. So you scan somewhere with ocean tiles and possibly some other tiles to try and find both hints. You might get an yellow level Ocean tile hint, which means you got that right but not entirely, and no other hint, remaining a red question mark.Well, turns out you should have had a 4-tile wide ocean where you scanned. Did you not leave any area like that on your map? Well, you\'re out of luck. Scan as you will, the game won\'t stop you or give you any idea of what\'s missing. And for the second requirement? Oh this species is only around below a certain temperature threshold, and you since you\'re in phase 3, you probably increased the temperature above that a while ago, so in the next run it is. AND you have to figure that out yourself.I know this is meant to encourage playing again, but when you have done well enough so far with the puzzles as to have spare resources, but still be unable to get 100% completion on the first try simple due to lack of previous knowledge is just not fun.',''),(2274,'It\'s a cute little game.Although shorter than I had expected for the price. As there are only 4 levels (with I guess 4 bonus levels) in which you go through in less than an hour each.It\'s kinda strange, it was a good experience, but it leaves me a bit on the side with the thought of wanting more...Personally I already would recommend it for the concept alone, but the experience feels a little shallow to justify the price.If part of it is a donation for helping the planet, I wouldn\'t have mind. But just for the game itself...I think it\'s better to pick it up on a sale.',''),(2275,'Fun little game - very satisfying at first but starts to feel like a chore after while. Regardless, it is one of the few games that has gripped my attention and got part of me wanting to complete every level to 100%.

There is an impressive game map, oodles of enemies and items, and lots of fun thematic elements. The music is pretty nice too. The overall soundboard is great, and there are fun voice lines for all the enemies. The game world feels alive in a way, and it\'s pretty immersive for a top-down game. The graphics and visuals are a somewhat unique cartoonish style that I find both lighthearted and grim at the same time. There is a day-night cycle, critical to a vampire\'s concerns for obvious reasons, in which you find yourself managing activities based on time. The base building is fun and role immersive, meaning you can make your castle spooky and strange, utilitarian, silly, or whatever suits you. For PvP, it\'s obviously more about defensive and offensive strategy. As a small disclaimer, I enjoy this game casually, having spun up my own PvE server. I\'ve not taken part in PvP. I hear it gets pretty intense, I just frankly don\'t enjoy PvP in this sort of game. I\'ve never played on public servers!PvE is often challenging, especially all the mini-bosses you must defeat to earn various powers and crafting recipes. Combat in general is fun because it does require some effort, with each enemy type and each boss having their own mechanics to learn and play around. There are many different weapons and spells, each with their own unique abilities, flavor, and preferred enemy effectiveness. I find I have one main setup that I usually enjoy, switching to different weapons or even changing spells on occasion if a particular enemy is difficult or calls for a wildly different strategy.There are a huge number of recipes and crafted items. As you go along, you unlock more. These items range from base parts, crafting stations, storage boxes, weapons, armor, potions, and the list goes on. All of the things are interesting and unique, and you find yourself excited to craft the next new thing.I really enjoy all the transforming abilities. It\'s pretty fun being able to turn into a bat, bear, wolf, toad, rat, or even don a \'human disguise\' for trading coin for goods with the locals. The various forms unlock the ability to traverse the landscape in new ways, or even aid in combat. I also enjoy the horse riding method of getting around the map, especially once you can \'dominate\' a horse to make it into your own special spooky vampire horse hoopty.There\'s also an interesting facet of play involving the magical capture of NPC\'s. They can be taken as servants and sent on supply missions or even used to defend your base from PvP attacks. You can also capture and keep various NPCs you find in game, imprisoning them. You must feed them and balance their health and misery gauges to keep them alive. You do this because they can supply your character with blood of various types depending on whom you\'ve imprisoned,  each NPC type is also blood type and will have a random quality percentage. These can weakened in combat and then fed upon in the field, killing them, to receive temporary relevant bonuses to your character. However, capturing them means you can choose to have an ongoing supply of a desirable bonus. While adventuring, simply identify an NPC with a blood type conferring the desired bonuses that is of high quality. You weaken them, then \"dominate\" them magically to lead them to your prison. It\'s a pretty interesting system in my opinion.You will eventually have legendary items and armors which confer various bonuses, as well as modifier items to \'tweak\' spells in various ways. Through these, you can create custom \"builds\" to play in a way that suits you. There are so many that I couldn\'t begin to guess how many possibilities there are. I love that level of deep customization in any game, though at first it\'s a bit overwhelming perhaps. I started just using whatever I found until I got a few items which seemed to play well together or combo in fun ways.As far as end game, well that remains to be seen for me. I\'ve got 139 hours in at the time of this review. I\'ve build a few different bases across two character runs. I\'m currently only about 3/4 of the way through the bosses I think. I do believe there are some extra hard challenge bosses at the end. I think the only real end-game beyond that is just playing around with base building, perfecting character builds, collecting the cosmetic helmets, or perhaps moving onto trying PvP- but from what I understand that really requires a team of friends to accomplish successfully and have fun doing so. There probably are solo/no-teaming servers for PvP, but as I mentioned I\'m not personally interested in PvP in this sort of game.There are a couple cosmetic dlc\'s you can purchase. These in no way at all enhance character power or ability, nor are they required in the least to play and enjoy every item and area of the game. This is a huge plus to me, as so many other games have gone a bad direction with dlc\'s.Negatives?Well, it can be a bit boorish alone if you aren\'t into this sort of base-building/crafting/harvesting sort of game. Best to play with a few friends, as is often the case for many games. Controls are a bit hard to master at first, with mouse cursor position dictating attack direction independent of WASD, all while using right mouse button to rotate the camera around. And it can be a bit hard for some- I wouldn\'t let the cartoonish graphics fool you, this game can be brutal. Steering the horse was a pain at first too, but eventually you\'ll get the hang of it. (not sure if there\'s controller support or not, I use keyboard/mouse) And lastly, I feel that while the character creation options are mostly sufficient, the armor \'looks\' cannot be changed. This bothers me. You can customize the character, and collect dozens of different capes and hats, but you cannot currently change your armor appearance or color. The armor just is what it is. Not that it looks bad, but I really feel they missed the bar by not creating a customization option for the armor colors. It\'s not a deal breaker, but it does bug me. A role-playing game of any sort in 2023 should have all kinds of character customization! Maybe they\'ll add that in the future? Let\'s hope.I hope you enjoyed my review! It\'s not very in depth, but I feel you can watch gameplay on youtube to get a better sense of the visuals, combat, and crafting. I do highly recommend this game overall, and especially so if you enjoyed Valheim, 7-days, Ark, or other base builders.Cheers,Luckymod13',''),(2298,'1/16 STORY🔲 No story✅ Not main aspect🔲 Bad story🔲 Average🔲 Good🔲 It\'ll replace your life2/16 GAMEPLAY🔲 Lifeless / static🔲 Poor UI🔲 Average🔲 Good✅ Excellent3/16 DIFFICULTY🔲 Playing asleep🔲 Some brain usage✅ If you take time to overgear yourself a bit and use the right build and consumables, most bosses become a cakewalk.

Pros--Amazing base building-Combat against regular enemies is very enjoyable-Co-op outside boss arenas is super fun -Vampire theme done right-Resource gathering isn\'t an awful grind-Map is a great size with done of variety with enemies and locations-Many things that it does different that worksCons:-Locking stronger armor/weapons behind bosses is the absolute dumbest thing I could think of and I feel like this is one of the main reasons that the game has a lower than average player count. Let me explain for those of you that are actually planning on getting the game. You cannot upgrade your character with better gear until you kill certain bosses. So if you are stuck on a boss the only thing you can grind for is stuff to repair your armor/weapons. You will not be able to make anything better. For anyone defending this system you are actively the reason why this game will perish. This is something I hope won\'t happen but I am being realistic.-Boss fights are the most unfun I have ever had in a game, you are always struggling with bosses since upgrades are locked behind their deaths. They are even worse in co-op since the boss scales with how many players are with you and normally this would be fine if it was an even scale like many souls games for example. But its almost like the devs didn\'t even try their own game and sometimes you can tell where the skimmed through without making sure this would work with the community.-IF YOU ARE SOLO there is a good chance you will not enjoy the game. And again this does go back to the bosses especially once you reach level 60 (spider queen). I recommend any of you to watch this boss fight on youtube and tell me if this actually looks enjoyable. Also there are a few wandering bosses that despawn if you do not kill them fast enough. SIDE NOTE: I know this looks like I am raging at only the boss fights but trust me the boss fights are literally the main part of the game. You literally cannot progress any other way.This is pretty much it  when it comes to this review and although there is more good than bad.

Beware! it is too addictive!',''),(2316,'all right then. keep your Bloodborne Sony.',''),(2317,'Amazing and wonderful game Hard but if you give yourself time to practice perfect guard you will not have any problem progressing the game.',''),(2318,'A Souls-Like worthy of the name.',''),(2319,'My favorite thing about Lies of P is it\'s potential for player expression. You\'re allowed to beat the game (mostly) however you want. You can \'Perfect Guard\' every encounter, dodge every enemy attack, or do a mixture of both whenever you see fit. Typically, there are better approaches to every fight, but the game will meet you on your own terms and give you the freedom to choose how you tackle it. You\'re allowed to build any weapon you want by combining different blades with different handles or use any special boss weapon from the various fights throughout the game. If you want to stick a giant wrench to the end of a dagger handle, you can. If you want to put a greatsword blade on a rapier hilt, you can. This simple tweak to a standard weapon selection system adds so much variety between every playthrough and every person\'s experience with the game.You\'ll encounter several boss fights over your 30-hour playthrough of the game. Most of them are good, if not great, while a few of them not so much. Bosses are incredibly aggressive, but readable and reactable, say for a few \'Fury Attacks\' which require memorization in timing as opposed to testing of reactions. I was actually surprised to see how many fantastic fights this game offers. There are several bosses I would understand seeing at the top of someone\'s favorite Lies of P boss list. The game is also a lot harder than I was expecting with several bosses taking over an hour, sometimes up to 3, to beat. Another thing to note is the game\'s story. I won\'t be giving any summary here, but I\'m surprised at how invested I actually was in the characters and story surrounding them. It\'s a refreshing change to see a game in this genre with such a defined and explicit narrative. There were more than a few characters I grew to genuinely really like and feel for. Complementing the story is the great soundtrack through the game. This includes boss themes, as well as the vinyls you can obtain and play in the Hotel hub area. The songs used give the desolate and depressing world so much more life and context. The world of Lies of P is beautiful and feels lived-in and overrun by the puppets and corrupted roaming about. It could have done better with more impurities in the objects around the levels and architecture, but that\'s more of a nitpick than anything.The game isn\'t perfect, however. It falters towards the end and stumbles in it\'s final act. After Laxasia , you feel like you\'re closing in on the finale, but then it sort of just continues for a bit too long before the actual end of the game. The reason I take issue with this area is because up until this point the game has done an incredible job at making every location feel fresh with new or remixed enemy types, level design, and area visuals. But this final stretch feels like a retread of the last few areas without enough of a difference to warrant being included. You could argue that this serves as a sort of down-time before the final fight, but the enemies here are just as aggressive as usual and you\'ll probably end up running past all of them at this point.All in all, Lies of P is one of the biggest sleeper hits in recent memory and surpassed the expectations I had for it by a  long shot. It\'s one of the best \'Soulslike\' games I\'ve had the privilege of playing, and I\'m incredibly excited to see the upcoming DLC and whatever next game comes from this series.',''),(2320,'femboy',''),(2321,'We have bloodborne on pc (lies)',''),(2322,'This game should be the standard for storytelling and world building for souls-like.',''),(2323,'Lies of P, as you might have known already, is a lovechild of Sekiro and Bloodborne, and although Lies of P didn’t really do anything out of the ordinary or made any breakthrough in anything, the game is still very fun and fantastic and is probably the best souls-like I ever played that is not from Fromsoft, judging after finishing my first playthrough which took me about 30 hours.

Same for those who prefer dodging or attacking from a distance with a big sword - you folks can too defeat bosses and progress through the storyline.

Combat was very solid, Cross between Bloodborne and Sekiro with parrying attacks the main goal rather than trying to dodge everything. Bosses were solid, Some felt fairly straightforward but others you really needed a strat rather than going all in aggressive.

Roguelikes actually want you to complete them as the real fun in them lies in completing them multiple ways, and changing your decisions to get more interesting results...but this is narrative game about a woman trapped in an endless cycle of torment and they want you to feel that.

When I compare to a game like Timberborn which has seemingly endless things to unlock after 10s and 10s of hours, this feels like the most unfinished part. The game could benefit from better pacing and more unlocks. - Courting only goes so far.. unclear end goal - No war.. why did I train so many soldiers? - Not enough quests.. Not always something to do - Hardly anything for the hero to do - Trading doesn\'t refresh and so you can only do so much with your excess resources - Needs better population management.

Generally speaking, most city builders suffer from the same general problem of \'sameyness\', so getting to a \'complete\' state ends up happening rather quickly in this genre, I can\'t honestly fault the developers for that. The bit about uneven tech unlocks comes from, in my mind, certain technologies that are in the game, either fully implemented, or currently being worked on, should realistically come out ahead of or at the same time, as others. But that is simply my bias rearing its ugly head. Then of course, there is the early access tag, which, may be a turn off for some people.

This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal.

In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life.

And, oh god, isn\'t it such a beatiful thing?I\'ve always had a soft spot for strategy games. I grew up with RTS mostly, but I\'m no stranger to Turn-Based 4X or Tactics (my favorite genre). It all started with HoMM3 and onward with Civilization 3 and many others from then on...To be frank, I didn\'t really know much about this franchise... I\'ve owned AoW3 and didn\'t play it much, as I thought it was an ugly game for its generation. Moreover, 4X games tend to be somewhat exhausting as matches can last for days and some have annoying little micromanagement quirks. This is not the case in Age of Wonders 4.To elaborate, this is a game that rewards your creativity and doesn\'t require much knowledge or the previously mentioned genres. It is a very solid entry into 4X and turn based strategy. A lot of it\'s inner workings are rather simple: you have a throne city, which you must expand by capturing provinces (in game tiles) and a ruler, who acts like a hero/general unit that you can level up through combat agaisnt other factions or neutral armies. On top of that, as your turns pass by, you research magic by choosing tomes, each containing a few reseach projects that last a few turns each to complete. Here is where the beauty of this game shines through.As stated before, this is a game that rewards your creativity a lot:You may play with any of the default rulers and their races or create your own.In the tomes system, you can make an absurd number of combinations: Want some evil elf barbarians? Game got you. Ruled by a dragon overlord? Got\'cha. Eventually transform your people into draconic hybrids? Hell yeah, brutha :vAs you progress through the story or random matches, be them online or single player, you unlock cosmetics and traits to further increase your options when creating races and rulers.Several events in the game in which you are presented choices which will impact the way your game develops, or even the race you created, by obtaining permanent traits through the outcomes of such events.Lords you have won games with in realms can be ascended, which allows you to have them in your games as recruitable heroes or even allies rulers, maybe you\'ll see some of your creations as oponents or free cities you can annex or vassalize.Every race is different from one another: different units, aesthetic and the way they usually play, their advantages and disadvantages. Some rewarding an evil playthrough or good one. Because, yes, there is an alignment meter which will come into play for your available decisions in random events.Every tome you choose will have an assortment of enchantments to augment your racial units (poison arrows, frost weapons, anyone?), spells to use either in combat or the world map or even more units (!!) which can determine your strategies not only in battle, but as you reach out for victory. The list would go on and this would turn into a major wall of text. Do yourself favor and play this game when you are able.It is simple to learn but by no means less fun because of that, plus an active modding community adding even more options? Yes, please.',''),(2384,'Create your own faction up to the smallest details, and crush your enemies in a turn-based 4X fantasy world that you can fully customize. Play the good guys or conquer the world. Explore, experiment, defy the usual tropes and try new perspectives. There’s plenty of room for roleplaying if you are inclined to do so. You’re in for a great experience.On the board, Age of Wonders 4 behaves like a regular 4X game, complete with the expected elements (medieval setting, no firearms or futuristic technologies, use of magic, diverse sentient races) along with your personal preferences. Turn-based battles allow for another level of depth, and using spells and enchantments against your enemies is very fun.The star of the show is customization. You can either go wild with creativity or stick to convention. Want to play Tolkien’s standard-issue elves against a rising evil power? You can. But you can also play undead feudal toads, honorable faith-bound orcs, angelic moles, scholarly crocodiles or vicious, barbaric halflings. The fact that you can personalize your faction leader gives you even more fantastic options. A draconic overlord leading a troop of enslaved dwarves? A minute wizard rat as the monarch of a human kingdom? Yes, you can.Age of Wonders 4 follows the current trend of “multiverses” that so commonly these days explains the infinite possibilities of characters in different situations. You play as a god or “godir”—one of many—that visits one of the countless realms (game worlds) to fight other godirs for dominance. A game within a game, if your godir dies she returns to the afterlife hub to try again, and the same will happen to your opponents. Or you can play as a commoner in one of such realms, fighting to win the right to ascend to your very own pantheon of divinities. You can create as many as you want, and play with them however you like. The only real way to kill a godir is by deleting him from your game options.The models are gorgeous, colorful and varied, and there are lots of them. Mythical creatures, extraplanar beings, animals and people are all depicted in detail and variety. The animations are excellent, despite some clipping with capes and beards—something quite common in games of all flavors. The graphical style is fine, even if not too original, but the interface feels a little bit dated and derivative.There’s a wonderful feature that I’ve noticed after a long time playing, that is seldom mentioned elsewhere. Depending on your chosen race and traits, you will be able to construct certain buildings that make for a unique scenario experience. My shadow dwarves were able to build experimentation chambers and underground laboratories, but those were not available to the rest of my factions.The concept of magic is associated to tomes, which contain spells that share a common topic. While there are some more advanced and powerful than others, you will never be restricted to a specific magical school. There’s something for everyone, and you can alter your strategies on the spot. You’ll find spells that can summon mythical creatures and monsters, buff your allies, enchant your weapons, and even alter the climate and turn the landscape into a barren wasteland, a frozen desert or a lush forest.There is a moral system in place, but I found it somewhat rudimentary or too simplistic, that tends to polarize factions and influence certain situations. An artificial “karma” of sorts will mean that if you behave in a wrongful way, you could even get worse results in dilemmas and choice events. I personally disliked this, since it takes away some of the fun of being evil.The music is fine; sometimes overly dramatic and with little thematic variation. I found it repetitive after a while, especially in the faction creation screen. If you’re like me and most of the usual gamers of the genre, you’ll spend a lot of time here. There is little voice acting—mostly in terms of flavor text—but it’s solid.Mechanics-wise, Age of Wonders 4 is best played with mouse and keyboard. Misclicks are sadly common thanks to a cluttered interface, army models and banners in the world map. Sometimes the use of right and left clicks was unclear to me, but this is mitigated with on-screen help. I did not encounter a single error, crash or bug in over 80 hours of playtime.The triumph of Age of Wonders 4 is its enormous flexibility, which derives in the huge number of possibilities for you to shape your gameplay to your liking. If you have played other fantasy games before, you’ll soon appreciate this. Those titles will eventually appear too rigid and limited, but we must remember that with many available options comes generalization and a lack of focus.I’ve heard some comments on the apparent blandness of the game, but you can’t be universal and highly customizable without being abstract and generalist. That’s the price to be paid for personalization, and it’s perfectly fine.I bought the premium edition with a small pre-order discount. So far, the experience has been satisfactory, and the game content is plenty and adequate. The DLC so far has been nice and adds meaningful elements to an already interesting gameplay, like the ability to play as a dragon lord, and an additional race and culture.If the idea of having a powerful playground full of alternatives to create your dream realm of fantasy tropes appeals to you, you’ll love this game.Wonderfully recommended.',''),(2385,'Overall a quite enjoyable game. If you liked Age of Wonders: planetfall you\'ll like this one as well. The game looks really nice, I really like the artstyle the animations the whole thing. The DLC faction and dragon lords are amazing (granted they are DLC but still at least they deliver). Also the whole system with the race alterations that visually show up on all your units is really nice.Buuuuut there are a few things that are really irksome.Main thing is the AI. Its dumb as a bag of rocks. The enemy cheats (spawning units from thin air completing construction quicker that sort of thing) which i think is fine because otherwise it would be way too easy. Where it becomes annoying as all hell is when you get the bright idea that you don\'t want to murder everyone. Now in that case the AI is really nice and rewards you with blocking you in with outposts, taking all of the free city vassals and just generally being really annoying.And diplomacy is a joke you can sell territory to AI but you can never buy it (which would really easily solve the blocking in problem)The other thing is the story. In previous titles in a campaign there was some persistent characters that you got to level up gather some good artefacts and so forth. Here there is not even a campaign. You have story realms that are technically campaign missions but for example if you want to play the whole thing with one leader you are starting lvl 1 on every map. And the storyline is kinda all over the place as well. Fair enough this last one is pretty subjective but i still want to point it out. But hey maybe you\'ll like it.So yeah if you want a good turn based strategy game then its a good buy. If you liked Age of wonders: planetfall i can whole heartedly recommend it.If you want to play something akin to Age of Wonders 1 or 3 then only go for it if you are willing to put up with the above mentioned things.',''),(2386,'The strength of this game is how customizable it is. You can define your nation and leader with a ton of different choices. There are lots of options for generating random maps and scenarios. Once the game starts, you can customize your heroes, cities, and research. There are so many spells to learn, items to collect, and units to build. I don\'t know if I\'ve played a game of this sort with more options.People say the AI isn\'t very good. I\'m not sure if that\'s true. It feels competent to me, but I\'m not a very skilled player. I treat the game more like an RPG, and I try to make decisions that are interesting rather than optimized.I used to auto-resolve all the battles, but then I stopped because the detailed battle system really is half the game.',''),(2387,'I\'ve grown up with the Age of Wonders series, and I believe that Age of Wonders 4 is not only the best of the series, it\'s a powerhouse of a 4X game with a deep magic and race system that evolves through playtime. Note that my review is entirely from a single player perspective.There\'s a lot to talk about here, but the key points (from me) are:- Extreme Customisation: Each race can intermix with a variety of civilisation types, which can also match across a variety of magic types. Entire maps (worlds) are randomly-generated with player input. - Robust Magic System: If you like to get all in-depth with your magic types, you\'ll have fun here. Explore the ends of power in several unique schools of magic. Spells are used at a World, Army, and Combat level. - Good UI: With so much information available at any given time, AoW4 does a good job making everything easily accessible. I believe good UI is important for long-term engagement, and Age of Wonders 4 makes the game easily accessible to those familiar with 4X games at a surface level, but it\'s also structured to feel familiar to experienced players. - Steam Workshop Integration: While I\'m generally not in to modding my games at all, the Workshop here does offer many tweaks to affect the game.  In my case, I use a mod that provides some better unit scaling for combat and I still get Steam achievements.The AI and difficulty can be disastrous, however. AI and the interplay between NPC entities and the player are downright bad at times. Additionally, vassals cannot be trusted for help without explicitly directing it, which felt odd. On a global scale, it\'s very difficult to \'make friends\' with the AI, as it feels very easily for everything to degrade into squabble and battle. For example, my lawfully-good humans won by conquest (naturally), vs my full-evil frostlings winning by diplomatic victory (difficultly). It\'s kind of a case where modern AI thinking just devolves in to \"combat\" so I hope this can improve.Some players like how races transform as they gain power, some players do not like this.  What you need to know is this: you can have a race of cat people who can evolve in to beings that are not cats, thereby making them less \'cat people\' and more \'new people\'. Like, a cat person who is also made of tree. Or fire.  Or frost.  It\'s going to happen, so - be warned, I guess.It\'s not perfect, but Age of Wonders 4 is a great, modern fantasy civilisation strategy game with a focus on all the good stuff like Heroes and Hero types, races and abilities, underground worlds, independent city states, battles of good / evil, allegiances born and failed; there\'s just a lot to take in.  It\'s most definitely in the conversation for Game of the Year, but in a year with so many great titles, AoW4 is an underdog.Get it in a bundle with DLC if you think you\'ll probably be interested, otherwise just wait for a deep discount and grab it then.  In either case, you won\'t be disappointed. Recommended.',''),(2388,'It\'s a good game that gets me hooked. I like the age the game is based in plus the city building and war. The game has an immersive experience. The game has a couple issues though. My two biggest issues with the game are the extremely long turn time and daily crashes. The turn time can take minutes which really starts to take a toll on you as you progress. The daily crashes are annoying because I\'ll have to redo my current turn and then I\'ll have to wait for the extremely long turn time again.Again, I really like the game and play it all the time. There are definitely a couple areas of improvement.',''),(2389,'If you enjoy Civ, then you\'ll enjoy this. It\'s like Civ but with a fantasy world theme.',''),(2390,'It\'s alright, but it just doesn\'t reach the peak that Age of Wonders 3 or Planetfall did for me. 3 had stronger unit designs, and racial features were more fun and distinct. The random world gen for 3 wasn\'t great, but the handcrafted maps were very strong.Planetfall\'s upgrades made low tier units more relevant, the larger provinces felt better, and cities having inbuilt garrisons was a welcome feature.Both had better combat maps, and both had a decently long campaign, whereas 4\'s maps all feel too flat and the campaign is much too short. Computer turns also take an incredibly long time.4 isn\'t terrible, but I have a hard time recommending it over one of the prior entries.',''),(2391,'Great fun, easy to get into, despite initially being overwhelmed by options! Tooltips are very well made and crystal clear you pick it up in no time at all. Endless customisation options that allow for very different experiences each playthrough. Dragon DLC is really worth it and a lot of fun. Excellent game!',''),(2392,'I made a race of order following rat-people led by a hairy and stubby dragon I named the giant rat that makes all of the rules 10/10.',''),(2393,'I was expecting a fun and complete game, it seems like the base game is missing key 4X features that look to come from the DLC and I do not like to purchase games that do not have good stand alone gameplay prior to DLC expansions.',''),(2394,'Best Age of Wonders game yet.  I\'m terrible at it, but I\'m still really enjoying it.',''),(2395,'If you\'ve played any of the previous games in the Age of Wonders franchise, you know you\'re getting into and AoW4 takes the core experience you know and love to the next level.If you\'re new to Age of Wonders, don\'t worry too much - Unless you are desperate to learn how The Second Age (AoW2 & Shadow Magic) plays out, The Fourth Age does a good job of welcoming newcomers into the fold whilst giving returning players something to look forward to.To recap the Third Age, you had campaigns with a strong narrative focus to them.  Some of them were relatively easy to get into, but there were instances that felt like you were playing a Square Enix game where the difficulty spikes all of a sudden.  The learning campaign didn\'t waste time knocking you around like that.  If you were one of the players walked passed the campaigns and played Random Map or jump into multiplayer, can\'t say I blame you because did exactly that.  AoW: Planetfall\'s campaigns objective focused whilst taking on the openness of a random map, AoW4 continues this open campaign style - I can understand why Triumph might\'ve gone that route, but I to SOME degree I can appreciate the sentiments regarding the lack of a story focused campaign.  Whilst the story heavy stuff is great for getting a feel for all the world building that goes into these games, the open nature of the game does allow newcomers the opportunity to learn at their own pace without having to jump through any potentially brutal scripted hurdles.  Given that AoW4 builds upon the insane level of customisation from AoW3, this game offers the level of DIY world building one would expect from Dungeons & Dragons.So what is Age of Wonders?It\'s a Roleplaying Grand Strategy franchise - You manage your empire and statecraft affairs 4X overworld map, whilst battles are fought as classic turn-based RPG encounters...  Unless you prefer to \"Roll\" your battles via the ol\' Auto-Resolve.Whilst Planetfall was the exception being a 1980\'s inspired space opera, Age of Wonders is typically a high fantasy themed franchise.  The basic rules of a game come down to this:  Your chosen/created \"Hero\" (statesman) and your Throne City (starting city/capital) are your \"King Pieces\".  Slay a player\'s avatar and sack their Throne City before their hero can respawn, they\'ve suffered a Military Defeat.  Otherwise, you have an assortment of goals similar to Sid Meier\'s Civilization.Age of Wonders 4 builds upon Planetfall\'s annexation system, where you are able to expand from an existing population centre by placing an exploitation (improvement) on an available territory connected to your given city\'s border.  This particular system really fleshed out the city building aspect of AoW compared to AoW3.  Near as what I can tell, unless there\'s a mod or I missed the flavour text in one of the realm creation options - There\'s no Nomadic start, something I miss from AoW3.  For most people, AoW4\'s world building comes from creating your hero and empire.  Sure, you\'re going to have your \"Min-Maxxers\".  But, your average roleplayer is going to be taking their time considering the options best suited for the character their looking to play.  Expect to be spending a good chunk of time in the creation suites if you are a roleplayer, because you\'re going to be setting up realms too.  It\'s a good thing you have a nice assortment of pre-constructed realms and characters, because some times you might want to get a feel for what you can create for your next session or just roleplay with what the developers took the time to craft.Soundtrack for Age of Wonders has had some memorable pieces by Michiel van den Bos, Age of Wonders 3 being the recent of them.  Age of Wonders 4 like Planetfall takes on more \"Soundscape\" oriented musical soundtrack - If you were more partial to AoW3, this soundtrack isn\'t going keep you captivated.  Chances are, you will let play out once or twice before firing up something like Spotify.Is Age of Wonders worth it?Not ONLY would I recommend it for lovers of both high fantasy RPGs and 4X strategy, if you can afford to...  Go Premium!',''),(2396,'Its a 4x game where the only thing to do fight. I normally don\'t like the focus on fighting. But this game makes you feel very powerful as you progress through tech.

I\'ve played strategy games that are based around magical worlds or middle ages. This game reminds me a little of Stellaris, huge difference, but you can customize any faction and have a different game each time. I played a game with 7 random factions, and happened to have 3 of them that had the same last names. My quest was to destroy all 3 of them. They were evil brothers lol. I never seen that in the 40 or so game i\'ve played, but each one is different.They games are very long. I haven\'t been able to try this with friends, but I think it would be so much fun with friends.I\'ve played Stronghold games, Warhammer games, Age of Empires games, Stellaris... and I think this might be my favorite game now.',''),(2400,'My opinion of Age of Wonders 4 is in comparison to Age of Wonders Planetfall, and it is worth noting that there are many ways in which AoW 4 practically styles on Planetfall in regards to improvements to gameplay. I simply couldn\'t list all of those improvements without them being the main body of this review, but in general many of the annoyances and roadblocks one might experience in a match of Planetfall are mitigated or outright gone in AoW 4.However, despite all of AoW 4\'s functional improvements over Planetfall, the game is completely lacking in terms of story and personality. When playing Planetfall, every world played on had a sense of character, every character and faction had motivations, goals, and ideological divides both internally and externally. As a point of example, I generally have a sort of \"peace and harmony\" strategy when making choices in video game campaigns, but I made several choices in Planetfall scenarios against that mentality on the basis that the characters in those scenarios wouldn\'t make those decisions. Put simply, the conflicts and characters within Planetfall are well written.Meanwhile, despite having 3 games of lore to draw from (4 if you count the experience from Planetfall), I only understood what was going on in AoW 4 in the vaguest of ways AFTER beating all of the campaigns. On top of that, some of the conflicts in the scenarios are flat out cop-outs. Without spoiling, the entire conflict that the story builds up to is rendered retroactively pointless and nonsensical, and two of the scenarios cop-out the interpersonal conflict part of the story by making the bad guy corrupted by magic evilness.All of that would be annoying and frustrating on its own, but what really irritates me is custom/random scenario tools for after you\'re done with the main story. Things as basic as a lighting change for the world (which the story scenarios have!) are not available, while the features that are there to be customized are heavily stripped down. I can\'t think of a succinct way of describing how pitiful and lacking the custom world options are beyond saying that you need look no farther than Planetfall to see it done right.Which brings me to my conclusion: as much as AoW 4 improves on Planetfall in many ways, if this game looks interesting to you, play Planetfall instead.PS. The AI tries to build cities as close as it can to strategic resources directly around your capital, to a degree that is both blatant and insane. If you don\'t believe me, this is a steam discussion on the issue, and you can find many more through people noting it through a simple google search: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1669000/discussions/0/5294588689491084454/ . To say that this is infuriating and ridiculous is an understatement; it has made my blood boil throughout much of the early game of nearly every scenario I\'ve played, and single-handedly caused numerous rage-restarts. F*k that.',''),(2401,'A bit simpler than I like as far as combat and city building goes...BUT, I still find it a lot of fun! Nice maps, interesting enough customisation of maps and races, a bit of RPG Hero tailoring....along with the joy of expanding your empire, minor diplomacy, and battling enemies with some neat looking units on the field, Overall worth it. If I can get 80 to 100 hours out of a game (minimum) without becoming bored or completely turned off a game, its worth it for me.',''),(2402,'A 4X game with a good battle system heavily inspired by Heroes of Might and Magic.The selling point here is customization : - You create your leader, a kind of demi-god to lead your race; from a mighty warrior, champion of its people to a slave-merchant warlock able to alter reality to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragon god anything you think of is possible, your leader doesn\'t need to be from the race you will play.- Then you create the race with its visual being independent of the racial traits you choose, you want some kind of nimble undead dwarves ? suit yourself, the possibilities are nearly infinite.- You then pick a faction from a pool of 6 (7 with DLC) each with its unique buildings, units, passive trait and leaning toward a play style that you can ignore if you want to.- Finally the fun really begins when you select a Tome, Tomes are the tech tree of the game. They give you the ability to buy new units, build strong buildings in your city, cast powerful spells to help you on the map on or battle and even enchant the weapons or even your race itself. There are 6 styles of Tomes each having 5 tiers the first 4 containing 2 tomes. This is how you make your race and your gameplay unique and this is extremely fun even just theorycrafting builds. There are some Story maps you can play at start to get used to the system but you will probably use CUSTOM MAPS where you can chose a lot of settings to alter the experience and even some weird victory conditions allowing for a good hundred of hours of chaotic fun.',''),(2403,'proving to my dad that being a good father is easy',''),(2404,'A daughter raising game that reminds me of princess maker.

Art is gorgeous, and I REALLY appreciate that the game allows you to pick MULTIPLE endings, and has stat decrease items to achieve even more endings in one save. I loved the story! It was very cute despite some of the flaws I saw in it\'s narrative.So are there any problems? Yes. 1) The English translation is NOT good. Sometimes I can barely understand what was happening. In fact, I didn\'t even know time looping was a thing until someone on a forum mentioned it to me. The English translation doesn\'t read like real people are speaking. As another example; I had difficulty telling whether Kenneth could REALLY not speak well, or if it was just the translation struggling to portray someone socially awkward. The translation NEEDS to be redone at some point, because there exist many english speakers who refuse to buy this game because the translation is so bad. 2) The plot has some holes because the protagonist (your daughter) is only an observing party until the very end of the game. You see, aside from the fathers memories.... the plot goes on without the player almost entirely in the background. And infact, one could argue that the plot is more about the mother, father and three lords... Not the daughter. And this is a problem; because there is a specific plot point concerning her father... where the daughter SHOULD\'VE been actively searching for a cure, but never did. She instead just keeps it a secret, and lets the three lords figure it out themselves while she lived life completely normally. And this caused narrative problems in the story, as certain plot points remain unclear which would\'ve otherwise made sense if the daughter was actually involved in the plot.3) I loved the characters, they just didn\'t have enough involvement in the story for me to feel much attachment. Other than the lords, only Nina is the only other reoccurring character in the plot. Every other character fundamentally doesn\'t matter, as they are not at all involved in the story and their events are completely optional.Characters such as Kenneth, Hackett and Ze had a LOT of potential for additional story points; but that potential is never actually explored or realised in the game.----In summary: LOVE THIS GAME! It\'s an upgrade over the \'Princess Maker series\' despite its flaws. However, I would like to someday see a better english translation, and perhaps some DLC concerning characters like Kenneth, Ze and Hackett. I feel like having them be the individual protagonist of their own mini episode would flesh out and get players more attached to their characters.If this devloper makes any future games, I hope that that they make the daughter more involved in the plot. And I hope for some more fantasy characters(Let us marry a demon lord!) and more fantasy endings. As those are my favourite elements in Gainax\'s princess maker series.',''),(2406,'Don\'t recommend playing this game if your native language is English.

Also has much more in depth friendship system though I really wish there was more character events then there currently is. This game also has a longer play style then Princess Maker. 1 full playthrough took me about a full day or a estimated 7 hours which is a BIG difference from the quicker playthroughs that Princess Maker generally had. That is if your going for the bigger endings.I must mention the translation for this game is a somewhat bad. Most of the time I can understand whats being said and happening but during the larger story reveal the bad translations made following far harder. I don\'t think its bad enough to drag the game down as I still enjoyed it a lot even with the errors but its something to be aware of. The beginning cutscene particularly is bad but it gets much better throughout the game in my opinion.The story overall is alot of fun, though I feel a weird about the fact that she can end up with the adults or her own professors. But you don\'t have to unless your 100 percenting the game and the gameplay really is fun so I can let it go. Its easy to make sure this doesn\'t happen just be sure your chosen love interest has the most relationship points. Though if the others reach a certain level as well you may get a dejected letter from other characters in the ending, but that\'s easy enough to skip through.

It has variety of things to do which are fun and interesting, a whole array of possible career, story, and romance (IT HAS HAREM AND REVERSE HAREM ENDING?! I\'m sold!) endings which is a requirement for a good CYOA/Simulation game, and a decent story plot (a bit of inconsistency at the conclusion but oh well).Do note that while the game is kind in offering wide-range of possibilities, this game is pretty rigid on the requirement of getting it so if you are a game completionist then please beware.

Relic charged full price for an incomplete \"Alpha\" version of the game.  Those of us who paid for it have been doing \"free testing\" for them.  Now, they announce a massive new update that finally \"finishes\" the game.  Yet, the new content is bundled into a new way to extract money out of their loyal fans.  16 bucks for this?  Come on.  It\'s not that I have a problem with the price or what you get it.  It\'s the fact that clearly those in charge are brain dead and completely tone deaf to their player base.  I can easily afford it.  I may end up caving in and paying the 16.  I also may never spend another dollar on a Relic game again.  Shocking.  why don\'t you do the right thing and include the new content for free to those who have already purchased the game as a way to say sorry for the complete and utter trash you that you released to us at full price?',''),(2424,'Play Company of Heroes 2 instead',''),(2425,'Wow... just wow. I normally don\'t leave reviews, regardless of whether I like or dislike a game, but I\'ll make an exception for this. I\'m a big fan of the franchise ever since I first played a demo of the original Company of Heroes at Gamescom. I love RTS games, and this was the wet dream of all players. Of course, it had its limitations, but they were manageable. I convinced all my friends to buy the game so we could play together, and we spent a lot of hours enjoying it.Then Company of Heroes 2 dropped – a new setting, more complex tactics, and, most of all, more different units and compositions to style your game. At launch, it had a lot of problems, so after buying the game, I uninstalled it to play Company of Heroes 1 again. But after a year, the game played like a charm, and although different commanders were locked and easier to obtain through paying with real money, they were also unlockable through in-game currency.Then Company of Heroes 3 was announced, and I was excited! So much that my friends, the same ones I convinced to buy the other two games, created a fake hard case of the game with pictures of me on it. Inside was a Steam gift card with which I pre-ordered the game. When it finally released, I played and played and played it. The gameplay was smooth for me, but the lack of basic things like multiple commanders and a new setting, which were present in the previous entries, disappointed me a little. I had hoped the game would finally visit the Japanese theater and include all previous factions in multiplayer for the ultimate Company of Heroes experience. Instead, we got an unrefined game even after one year of release, and the first big update that should include multiple commander choice/customization is a DLC? It feels like a joke. I don\'t work in the game industry, so I don\'t know if there are hidden reasons behind these paywalls and unfinished games coming out in the last couple of years. Or maybe it\'s because I\'m getting older, and my standards are changing, but this doesn\'t feel like the game studio I convinced many of my friends to buy multiple games from so we could play together.Company of Heroes is one of the games I always have installed on my PC. It\'s my go-to relax game after a hard day. I guess I\'ll have to go back to Company of Heroes 2.It pains me to say, but if you haven\'t bought the game yet, I suggest you\'re better of investing the money to buy Company of Heroes 2 and its DLC. Then you have a more complete game than when you get this one...',''),(2426,'I\'ve been following the CoH3 development and its general release very closely.  I\'ve been an avid CoH player for many years starting with the original game then the sequel.  I\'ve always been fond of the original CoH title since it\'s a rare gem in terms of gameplay and replay ability.  When CoH2 released I was excited for another CoH title and gladly bough the collector’s edition. This was also when THQ went bankrupt, and Relic became part of Sega.  I can only imagine what happened to CoH2 as a result from that change.  The result of CoH2 was quite a departure in the overall gameplay and replay ability that I loved so much from the original game.  The overall quality dropped quite a lot and was far more disappointed than I would have thought and the DLC\'s being released were not the DLC\'s (called expansions in those days…)  from Relic\'s older games that you would never think twice to purchase without question.  CoH2 really set the stage for my expectations of CoH3.  I would not preorder and wait until I felt satisfied that the game was worthwhile to play.CoH3 sounded amazing when it was announced but the development was rushed to release.  Despite delaying the games release to a few months later the initial game release was quite unpolished and unfinished, but I would argue CoH2 even in its end state is far worse to the current state of CoH3.  I wasn\'t part of CoH3 until the recent patch of Steel Shepperd.  I have heard it bought quite the improvement to the game but even before then I didn\'t see it as bad as what CoH2 was mainly due to a pathetic game engine that bugsplatted all the time until it got better with the 64-bit version of CoH2 that got released later in its lifespan.  CoH3 from initial impressions is quite satisfying but I can only imagine the state of the game before German Shepherd.  I got used to how bad CoH2 ran and even on a decent system seemed to perform bad regardless of what hardware you used, but CoH3 doesn’t exhibit those issues.  I find CoH3 a pleasant departure from the performance issues of CoH2.  I’ve been playing only for a few hours, but I find the current state of the game is worth the buy if you get a 20% or more discount.With the Steel Shepperd update came the first DLC (or expansion) as Relic calls it.  Its not an expansion all it provides is two battlegroups you can unlock for free using Merits and then a bunch of cosmetics.  The asking price for this content is very overpriced.  If you have prime gaming, you can get decent skins just from those drops.  The premium edition includes this DLC for free, but I would recommend you avoid the premium edition since its not justified by its price and what it provides players.  Most players who preordered the premium edition has been largely disappointed by what it provides for the money.As much as I wish Relic would remain in its glory days of making some of the best games of all time it simply hasn’t been for quite some time.  Relic refuses to deliver what its player base wants, and it puts anything and everything behind a massive paywall.  I’m honestly not sure if this is a decision by Relic or Sega or both.  I would confidently say that the overall value of DLC’s is quite questionable for what you get, and I can only imagine how the future DLC content will be moving forward.  I would, however, expect overpriced skins or other cosmetics or new battlegroups that for those that rely on them can introduce a pay to win scenario if Relic decides to not offer them to be obtainable in game without spending real money (such as using Merits instead).I would confidently say that CoH3 is a worthwhile title just be sure to be cautious of any DLC’s or Expansions that Relic might announce since it may not be what you may expect.  If you want a copy of CoH3 I would recommend purchasing the base game not the premium since it’s a better overall value in many regards.  I just hope that 10+ months later that Relic continues to support this game and not recreate the overall experience of CoH2 that left me very disappointed with a franchise that many hold dear in their hearts.  I have no issue supporting Relic, but Relic needs to support their fanbase and start going back to their roots for what made them so beloved for so many years.  I always have a glimmer of hope that Relic could do just that since CoH is still a great franchise!Added remarks after playing the game: (I’ll add content/updates here to not diminish my original review)For CoH3 specifically I’ve been playing Skirmishes and have noticed that playing the game the animations and the way the game plays is much improved compared to CoH2 and even CoH1.  The game feels very fluid compared to past CoH titles.  Arguably, CoH1 still has better visuals than CoH2, but I personally think currently CoH3 is better generally speaking.  CoH2 had some janky animations and odd things that would occur that CoH3 doesn’t exhibit such as dead units being able to attack you until they finally died – lol!  I do find that the character models don’t look overly improved from any of the older CoH titles and if you zoom into them, they don’t look much better and even loose a bit of detail and quality.  Perhaps Relic is using older models from the previous titles I’m honestly not sure but its not AAA title graphics but they sill look good none the less.  Keep in mind CoH games are far smaller games to install compared to AAA titles you are looking around 100GB’s per title.  They look fine when the camera is set to the default zoom.  I’ve also seen that CoH 3 has a decent map selection along with 4 factions to boot which past games you had to purchase expansions to get them.  I am also very pleased with the steam workshop coming to CoH3 where it was later integrated in CoH1 and 2 later in their life.  After a quick browse of the Steam Workshop for CoH3 there appears to be quite a wealth of content from maps, tuning packs and much more to choose from and it appears to be growing quite a lot.  I found once Relic stops patching the game the Steam Workshop brings a new life to the game which allows the game to remain engaging.  Overall, I find the factions and general gameplay elements such as the way the factions play along with the general controls to work quite well.  Maybe they are not optimally balanced, but their overall completeness feels quite better than previous titles.  It’s hard to explain but I felt in older games some of the factions clearly lacked in certain areas to a fault.  I feel in CoH3 there is something to work with the faction and its mechanics which is a welcome change.  I feel I can play as any faction and have some method to play the way I want to the way the faction plays.',''),(2427,'Many criticize this game for the lack of content (number of commanders/maps/etc), and it is absolutely deserved. However, what this game lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. The game play from COH2 has been incredibly polished. Units have unique and interesting abilities, unit path finding is excellent (usually), and the maps the game did release with are excellent. HOWEVER, I hate the breakneck, profits first approach Sega has imposed on Relic. The lack of content is not Relics fault. The developer team is relatively small and the time and resources they had to make this was insufficient. I\'m sure with a couple more expansions this game will be everything the fan base was hoping for. But I believe that fans are justifiably upset with the lack of quality. I want the game to be successful, so I am leaving a thumbs up.',''),(2428,'Starting to look like a Company of Heroes game',''),(2429,'I\'m one of those who played CoH 1 alot back in the day.When CoH 2 came out I got so disapointed.

You never got a sence of knowledge what your opponent specced and because of that you couldent counter it any way. Its just mouseclicking chaos in comparison to COH 1.Now, CoH 3 reminds me alot of CoH 1. And thats good. I\'m not much for singelplayer campaigns or vs AI.CoH 3 has fewer commanders again and that give you a better understanding of your enemy. More strategy and thats a +It also has smarter units, they jump over fenced by themselfs intelligently now.Also units has a slightly better hold out value and that let you keep your units alive a bit easier. Its so frustrating when you have 2 front combat and loose a unit where you are not looking.

I will never buy a Relic game on Day 1 ever again if they are given the chance to ever make another game...',''),(2433,'Edit - They have patched the issues with the BGs. Is it perfect; no. But it is now generally balanced and playable.COH3 has the promise of becoming a brilliant RTS.With the release of Hammer and Shield \"expansion\" the game is approaching an almost complete state. The updates to the UI and other graphics are brilliant, new sound design and two very flushed out battle-groups mark the end of the COH2 piecemeal commanders.The engine performance is a marked upgrade and while the graphics are arguably lacking compared to even the original COH, they aren\'t offensive enough to cause any real harm. A four faction release is also a big plus but it may have been better to maaaybbbee have focused on polishing two factions first and release the next two in rapid succession to fulfil the legal promises of an \"expansion\" without resorting to a pitiful, review bombed pair of battle-groups.The game still fails in its narrative. COH1 was the epitome of setting and tone done right. Graphic and sound design all worked towards a gritty and realistic war environment. COH2 was the edgy kid at the back of the class listening to Bring Me The Horizon that no one took seriously. COH3 doesn\'t feel like it knows what to be. It touts being a dark and gritty representation of war but is full of vibrant colours, tanks that look they\'re out of a \"my first army\" toy set and facepaint wearing Cherokee warrior skins. The campaign is poor, with comedic and stiff banter between the generals completing disrupting any sense of immersion, what\'s wrong with a sequential scenario based story campaign? But COH3 has one of those too! i hear you cry. Unfortunately It has the production value of a nativity play and is seriously lacking in comparison to even COH2\'s campaign.Overall I still enjoyed the game, I love the COH series with a passion, but even with my bias approach, the game is currently an utter failure.If you want immersive second world war then go play MoW, Call to Arms or Steel Division. COH3 aims to differentiate itself by being an excellent RTS first, with a poorly fitting WW2 coat. Yet the recent update \"Hammer and Shield\" has demonstrated the developers utter incompetence at balancing this game.Skill issue, I know. But we find ourselves re treading the same pitifully unbalanced path that COH2 followed. The recent update has introduced a meta of sim citying, the same thing that had plagued an earlier build of COH2 and the developers have either not play tested it properly or there\'s a hydraulic leak in the vents at the office because it has become an unplayable bunker building simulator with more artillery call ins than the somme. Remember Achelous River? Imagine being able to recreate that on every map.I had a friend who purchased every cosmetic in the store, who adamantly defended this game during it\'s unfinished initial release and I watched him give up today. If the developers continue to refine this game then it will one day reach the status of its predecessors but thing\'s like this that will whittle the fan base (and thus, the funding) down to an unsustainable level.I\'m going to go play some COH2.',''),(2434,'Coh2 is better',''),(2435,'I. Early Game ReviewBought this game today. Can\'t enter the game at first due to connection issue (you gotta be online to launch the game for the first time), not a big problem. I played the game, the gameplay mechanics are not so different from previous COH entries. Tutorial is good, it explained everything you need to play the game. Gameplay is actually fun, I enjoyed my first 106 minutes of this game.  Haven\'t tried the Campaign yet, but played the multiplayer and it was all good for me.  And with the addition of Tactical Pause feature, the singleplayer felt fun if you want to practice strategy in the field or to explore your playset.  The graphic is really something different and it\'s refreshing to my eyes (somehow). The battlefield felt more alive by removing most of its predecessor\'s gritty and dark atmosphere. Overall, I love it! I bought the COH3 Standard Edition during  discount  (IDR Rp. 428000; aprx. USD $29) and its absolutely worth the money (for me). Thank You to all of you guys!

I bought the premium digital edition, and I desperately want this game to succeed. But something is rotten in the HQ of Relic. The game, has been a solid and fun game since launch, but with tons of minor mistakes,  a large amount of missing features and content. I was hoping, that this new patch and content release would push the game in the right direction, and I does, to some extent. It\'s good content and a much-needed breath of fresh air. But... and yes there is a huge but. As of launch of patch 1.4 with the “Hammer and Shield” dlc, the game crashes every other game in multiplayer. I have had one crash prior to the release of \"Hammer and Shield\" over the course of 200ish hours. The balance has been effectively ruined by the overall buff of indirect fire, and sector artillery abilities of certain units and battlegroups. The game crashes, and is a bunker indirect-fire no-fun zone. The games strength, cover usage, flanking, light vehicle play, team weapons, cool mechanics etc., is now relegated to getting bombed until the game crashes. There is still a huge lack of multiplayer and skirmish maps, which makes the experience at best repetitive and at worst extremely tiresome. Charging 16.99 € for the “Hammer and Shield” dlc, and calling it an expansion is an insult. Do not buy the game or the \"expansion\". Hold off til the game gets better. Company of Heroes 2 is a great game today, and had a disastrous launch back in 2013. I hope that the devs get to mitigate the large amounts of issues with the game, and that Company of Heroes 3 will be the great game it has potential to become, before SEGA (or relic themselves) destroys the franchise.

It\'s quite incredible just how stripped down this game is compared to past entries. No I wouldn\'t recommend it. Get COH2 on sale or perhaps COH1 just to compare. This just isn\'t a full game.

CoH 2 I\'ve played on launch and as much as it was cool, it didn\'t felt like CoH 2 and it received a lot of hate of the fanbase, just like CoH 3 now. The game really began to shine after the USF and OKW expansions wth the Brits giving the final thumbs up to the fans before the devs focused only on ballancing the multiplayer experience and adding a few commanders here and there.CoH 3 have a much more fun campaing with a dynamic way to play it, even not being cinematic as the prior titles, its fun and challenging. The Afrikakorps campaing is short but will garantee a couple hours of fun and an interesting and educational story about german and british ocuppation in North Africa.The devs are now working on bringing more content and I truly believe this will be a solid and rich game in the near future.

COH1 was my favorite RTS after I delved into it, and while I tried to get into COH2, being years late to the party had me highly confused at pretty much everything that was being thrown my way. So many of the commanders in that game had abilities that others also had, in different slots, so it made a very difficult learning curve that stunted my desire to really learn. Didn\'t help that certain bugs (ie, laggy main menu) hadn\'t been fixed despite the longevity of the game.COH3 on the other hand is the sequel that I wanted. COH3 takes what\'s good from COH1, and grabs what they learned from COH2 to create a really fun experience. While the game isn\'t perfect, it\'s a lot of fun to dive into. My only complaints I can really say compared to COH1 is that the game features an in-game store and cosmetics can make it a bit trickier to tell what unit belongs to what team, however the big icon over each squad makes this mostly a non-issue, and the dynamic campaign is seemingly bugged/rebalanced to remove the ability to turn all overworld battles into various skirmishes (I really did like those), however the multiplayer is where I spend most of my time nowadays. All of the other bugs/issues I\'ve had from the launch of the game have been addressed at this point.The most recent update in December of 2023 was the first content drop we\'ve gotten, and it\'s been pretty fun so far.

After 20+ hours I\'m finding this game to be fun, which is a key consideration for me.

Game is full of bugs and connectivity issues',''),(2447,'It needs Fixes bigtime, stopped playing it untill EA gets their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ together',''),(2448,'When I saw Forspoken had mixed reviews, I figured I could dismiss the negative ones. Part of that was due to an early review of the trailer I read, which complained about the \"Whedonification and Marvelization of video game quipping\".   Between that narrative, and the mixed-race female lead, I figured it was just a few angry keyboard trolls down-rating what was actually going to be an impressive experience, with a cinematic game design philosophy behind it.Holy crap was I wrong. The game has two major problems: repetitiveness and inconsistency.  Let\'s start with the inconsistency. Imagine trying to yawn, and someone pokes their finger in your mouth to interrupt it.  Now, imagine playing a game where every time you have an instinct to explore, you get rewarded with that sensation.  That is the experience you\'ll have in reaction to several of the game\'s acrobatic mechanics.  You can jump up walls - but only some of them and they\'re not clearly marked.  You can grapple-swing like Spider-man, but only really short distances...except when you can swing really long ones.  You can skip through the air across large pillars just like in the trailer - only that experience only takes place in the one area, and the mechanic it\'s built around only functions reliably in this one particular region of the game (seeming as if this region was given extra attention specifically, just so it could be featured in a gameplay trailer). There\'s a move you learn early on where you can jump over enemies then punch the ground to shock them...only the system doesn\'t recognize 70% of the times you\'ve jumped over the enemy.  The game isn\'t broken or buggy mind you - it\'s just inconsistent physics and game mechanic performance.  It\'s essentially like hitting the gas in a car and not knowing how much acceleration to expect.  Basically, one of the games biggest selling points is one of it\'s weakest area of performance.  The game also encourages you to explore, yet - despite all of the acrobatic skill trees you\'re encouraged to develop - scaling the walls and mountains is entirely unpredictable.  Some you can cross, some you can not.  This makes tracking down your in-game chores by traversing large swaths of the game\'s maps - and they do feel like chores - incredibly difficult.  You never know when you can hop a mountain range, and when you\'re expected to hoof it. This leads to extensive 15 - 20 minute detours of areas you\'ve already been in.  It\'s not encouraging exploration, it\'s just artificially inflating gameplay time. That brings up the other problem: this game is seriously repetitive.  The soundtrack is bad enough, with less than 10 arrangements making up 80% of the soundtrack (if that doesn\'t sound bad, just wait till you\'re hearing the \'fight engagement\' theme for the 10,000th time).  What\'s worse though is the thing I was pretty excited about - your character Frey and the wristband Cuff bantering about.  They have about 12 minutes of 20-second conversations that loop ad nauseum throughout the game.  The first time you hear an exchange between the two, you will probably enjoy the writing.  The twentieth time Cuff is asking if everyone left because you annoyed them, you want to find out how such a simple part of the game could get so messed up.    That\'s just the audio though.  The game itself fails hard compared to games like Far Cry, Skyrim, and Mass Effect - TRUE AAA games.  They make repeating missions each feel unique and interesting.  Here, you\'re just doing chores on repeat, just with different skinned monsters to fight (something like 20 creatures, 3 skins each, with 10 attack patterns between them) across the games 8 major environment shifts (across 4 regions).Lastly, I\'d call out the project manager exclusively: They did a terrible job of balancing the game, the mechanics, the consistency of the game-play and difficulty, and even the flow between the \'quest\' mode and what are called \'detours\'.  The detours are meant to add to the story, and are written well enough. At the same time, the pacing is like walking through a gelatin desert. Repetitive & inconsistent, Forspoken is irritatingly addictive.  Despite having likely required the investment of any other AAA game release, no one should purchase Forspoken for more than $25 (US) in order to avoid rewarding poor game design and project management.  Ultimately, Forspoken is the reason why STEAM needs to have a 4-tier rating system rather than two (I\'d give it one thumb up rather than a negative downvote).  I won\'t say don\'t buy it, but DEFINITELY don\'t pay full price.',''),(2449,'Once upon a time, Square Enix crafted worlds that whisked us away from reality.

You\'d think being teleported to a fantasy world would broaden one\'s horizons, but no, Frey is as introspective as a mirror in a dark room.IGN hits the nail on the head, describing the game as a \"generic RPG with bland story and repetitive combat\"​​. They forgot to mention how Frey\'s constant navel-gazing turns every potential epic moment into a therapy session.It\'s like watching a modern-day Narcissus, but instead of a pond, she\'s got an entire magical world at her feet. PCMag points out the game would\'ve been passable a decade ago​​. Perhaps back then, we had lower standards for character development.The world of Athia is visually striking, but it’s wasted on a protagonist more interested in her own inner turmoil than the wonders around her. GamesRadar+ calls it an \"exceptionally middling experience\"​​, and they\'re being generous, especially for a game from Square. It\'s like being on a guided tour of paradise led by someone who can\'t stop talking about their bad day at work.Then there\'s the combat. GameSpot mentions the \"boring combat, poor characterization, and loose movement\"​​. If only Frey showed as much enthusiasm in her battles as she does in her self-pity, we might have had something exciting.In a time where she could\'ve been a beacon of hope or change, Frey chooses instead to wallow in self-reflection. PC Gamer suggests the game could have been excellent if it tried a little harder​​. Sadly, the same could be said about its main character.\"Forspoken\" had the potential to be a magical journey of growth and discovery. Instead, it’s a missed opportunity, bogged down by a protagonist whose self-centeredness is as vast as the world she fails to appreciate. Square Enix, we remember the days when your games inspired awe and wonder. Now, it seems, the only spell you\'ve cast is one of disillusionment.Based on prior reviews, I waited for it to be on sale. After playing it, I\'m not sure i\'d recommend it if it were free bonus content for an actual good game. In most other cases, I\'d say storage is cheap, but in this case, save the drive space.',''),(2450,'So, this is a difficult one. I\'m currently at arournd 11 hours of ingame time and haven\'t finished the game yet but I wanted to write a review anyway to share my thoughts and help people to decide whether or not to buy this game or avoid it. As you can see I do recommend the game, however there are different things that I put into consideration.But let\'s start with the negative points first. If you take into consideration that Square Enix who also created Life\'s Strange and a few other really good games, it\'s understandable if you\'re a bit disappointed. Which takes me to the next point. The game is priced at 80$ which is a ridiculous pricepoint for any game and I don\'t think I have ever seen a AAA Game at a pricetag this high without including any DLC\'s or Expansions. I have read other reviews of this game and people were complaining about how empty the Overworld is and boring the story. While playing I was sort of able to understand where the frustration came from, however I do not fully agree with that, more to that later. I believe that the difficulty setting only affects the enemies hp bar and not the difficulty of the fight itself. Which causes the fights to take longer and causing them to get tedious to some extend.But that\'s about it for the negative points. Let\'s get to the positive ones and the reason why I did end up recommending the game. The story itself is surprisingly good and the conversations between the main character and her \'companion\' are honestly hilarious and I personally love the sarcasm aspect. While the world is sort of unspectacular there are quite a lot of fights even if they\'re just 200 (overexaggerated) normal boring enemies or sometimes more challenging ones. So unless the people who were complaining simply ran from story point to story point without doing anything besides that I do not agree with their statement of the the overwolrd being extremely empty and boring. The graphic, although it looks like a game made for consoles, is actually beautiful, all you have to do is get used to the chosen graphical style. If playing the game you HAVE to play it on a controller as it\'s unplayable on MnK but when doing so the controls feel good and well thought out. The game has CATS! So that\'s a big plus and you can even pet them. The UI actually looks good, I really loke the color scheme they went for and the ability effects are also pretty neat.That\'s it for the positive aspects that\'re worth mentioning about this game and I\'m ending this review with my final thoughts.If I had bought the game at it\'s normal price tag then there is no way I would\'ve been able to recommend it, however I bought it during the autumn sale for around 30$ and that\'s the reason of my current recommendation status. The other part that is sort of bothering me is, that  it feels like this game was meant to be a more story focussed one (such as Life\'s Strange or Tomb Raider) and is sort of trying too hard to be open world to match the current trend AAA games are headed towards (even though it doesn\'t even need to be that) hence why the world is not as special compared to the world of The Witcher 3 or Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey. But it\'s still a good game and I do enjoy the time I\'ve spend playing it and I will continue to play the game and finish it\'s story. One last thing, the game could really be more optimised than it currently is, as I sometimes have frame drops below 60fps on a 4090 at only 2k resolution.I hope this review was able to help you choose whether to buy or avoid this game and if it did I\'m glad I was able to help with that!',''),(2451,'This game is absolute trash. How is it that a game that has been ported to pc gets zero support from square enix. I can\'t even play the game because the camera is just spinning non stop. I got the game refunded. it is really sad because the graphics look pretty cool no mater how woke the story is.',''),(2452,'Important note: I bought this at 60% discount.So, I think why this game flopped as hard as it did was the frankly absurd base price compared to the quality it offers. But if you pay 30 euros for it, suddenly it\'s actually quite good and I\'m much more likely to be forgiving.I can indeed confirm what other reviewers are saying, that the combat is really good and the rest is bad. Well... I wouldn\'t say \"bad\", more like... awkward. It\'s awkwardly paced, awkwardly written, awkward camera angles and cinematics etc etc. Stuff that you would forgive in an indie game, but not in a game that asks for 70 euros.It\'s a shame, because a sequel with a lot of polish and a bit tighter focus would have probably been amazing, but I heard that the studio has been axed, so... that\'s corporate greed for you, I guess.',''),(2453,'So much potential but terrible in execution:Protagonist is so whiny and annoying. You just can\'t gel with her or her decisions.Combat works but could have been so much betterBut... the performance and bugs! FPS drops are constant and sound is just broken (voice drops for certain chars, echoey sounds, distortion).Even moving to cut scenes is terrible... so jarring it breaks immersion.Story is ok and will keep you entertained for about 20 hours.Game does support ultra wide screen and HDR so that\'s nice.Summary - if they can fix the bugs and performance it\'s worth 15-20 quid in the steam sales.',''),(2454,'Not the best game ever, but way better than most people make it seem. I enjoyed it, though i did need a really powerfull PC to actually enjoy the incredible visuals and while the World does seem somewhat empty, i actually liked the atmosphere and the story.',''),(2455,'great visuals and animation BUT hollow world and unlike able characters',''),(2456,'Enjoyable game; reminiscent of Horizon: Zero Dawn, though H:ZD is a superior game.  I was hesitant - I\'m not usually a huge fan of games where parkour is a huge component.  But I\'m glad I stuck with it.  The story is decently compelling, and had at least one twist I didn\'t see coming.  The gameplay, once you master the parkour, is fast - I beat the game in 37 hours, though I did a fairly straight run with few side quests.  Note that it\'s not clear, when you\'re progressing, that some side quests (called detours in the game) will become unavailable if you don\'t finish them by a certain point.  There are warnings when you\'re moving to the next chapter, but they doesn\'t communicate clearly the consequences of that - and the guides I referenced on line generally spoke of quests being available \"after completing ______,\" but not of availability ending.  Combat is fast paced and reasonably fun.  It took me a while to get the hang of switching between magic systems, but once I did, that made the combet lively and interesting.  Complaints:  I feel like the first two (of twelve) chapters are essentially tutorials, and they drag a bit.  The video sequences aren\'t as engaging as they might be, and there are a LOT in chapter one.  I almost gave up because I felt like I was watching an interactive movie!  But it\'s worth it to wait through all that.  The last two chapters are similar, especially chapter 11.  Those video sequences could REALLY stand to be tightened up!  They got interminable after a while.  Talky-talky-talky ... that information didn\'t need to take ungodly long to impart.  But overall, the game was worth both the purchase price and the time.  Recommended, if you like games of this sort.',''),(2457,'So, I do overall recommend this game(When it\'s on sale absolutely not for $70), it\'s actually fun when the game just let\'s you play and leaves you alone, however, Frey is the worst game protagonist of all time. She never gets better, she is selfish and awful the entire game. I recommend reducing in game chatter to low or off, and just kind of dealing with Frey. The journey is rather predictable but pretty satisfying to see the closure. It can be completed in about 18 hours. One of the ending cutscenes isn\'t in engine, it\'s like sort of pre-rended and looks like a youtube video with bad compression and I just found that funny. FSR3 is cool tech and the game looks nice and utilizes it well.Tl;drGame funFrey badDon\'t pay full price.',''),(2458,'i will say the main issue with the game is Frey\'s voice acting and her character as a whole. She is unbearable and annoying. The gameplay itself if fun but gets bogged down by constant comments by Frey and she is mega cringe with her Marvelesque quips. I give it a thumbs up just for the gameplay and combat system. The movement and freedom are also a plus. Overall not as bad as when it came out. definitely get it when it\'s on sale i wouldn\'t pay more than $40 for this',''),(2459,'I got the game on sale, but bookmarked it on release. Hesitant as the reviews were so negative, instead I am enjoying myself. Full price would have been dicey, but this is a massive game with plenty to do and things to blast.Somehow Fable springs to mind, positive energy story, and plenty of monsters  to slay at not too hard a difficulty.  So great for a few spare hours of relaxed exploring.',''),(2460,'All this game and the controversy surrounding it proves to me is that mob mentality is a strong force. The overall story and presentation kind of reminds me of a fantasy made-for-tv movie but for this it works in it\'s favour. The only issue I had coming from the demo was that the quips and banter between the characters in the open world would become grating, but after a few hours it was fine. It kind of reminded me of the repetitiveness of Ordis from Warframe. Also to be honest the dialogue in general being described as over the top cringy is a little ironic looking back on it. The way the lines were delivered had almost exactly the same energy as the majority of the current era marvel films and I don\'t see anybody complaining about them. The music was great, and fit the story pretty well. I would say Frey\'s theme was by far my favourite and hearing the motif show up through most of the in-game music definitely made me feel a little emotional at times. There were a few negative points though. For some reason the sky textures looked horrendous no matter what I put the settings on and took me out of the game a couple times. Everything else was textured fine but then there would be this eyesore every time I looked up. About the only story point I would change is maybe the length of time they try to keep Frey\'s selfishness story beat going.Performance wise I can\'t say too much as I\'m currently using a 4070ti. It gets me about 75-80 FPS average on 3440x1440 with ultra settings, DLSS Quality and the extra Raytracing settings and about 80 without. Honestly though the Fidelity FX and raytracing options aren\'t worth the performance hitStory length to side content ratio is a little wonky. I would have liked to have either the story a little longer (which probably would hurt it to be honest as it feels like it would end up with quite a bit filler content), or for there to be either less, but more meaningful side content to balance everything out.Open world wise I enjoy going out and seeing all the landmarks and getting equipment but the Mana collection system is definitely not something I enjoy. Getting mana just through levels or having a wide range vacuum for them that didn\'t have a cooldown would\'ve been a real help and would\'ve fixed some of the monotony. Also, too many spells. I think perhaps they should have followed the 5 or so abilities for each damage type like FFXVI. It would have made the combat a little more focused.*UPDATEAfter getting all the achievements I can say the side content is incredibly out of proportion. expect up to 20 hours of storyline with some occasional sidetracking but 30-40 extra for open world/ side content. I wouldn\'t suggest doing anything beyond the story/DLC unless you\'re a dedicated completionist.*Long story short, the majority of people who are dog-piling on the game at this point usually have an inability to think for themselves and fail to see things objectively. Ultimately you can decide whether you like the game or not, but don\'t let others make your decision for you. It\'s definitely not $114.95 AUD good, but if you can get it on sale for under $60, it\'s worth a try.',''),(2461,'It\'s a really good game. Not sure what others are talking about. The worst part is the UI, but that can probably be attributed rushed timelines so I\'ll knock half a point off for that.Everything else is more or less excellent. The world it is set in is huge and fantastically beautiful. AAA quality graphics and gameplay that is essentially 4D Sonic.',''),(2462,'Not the best, but way better than people make it seem. Enjoyed it, though it gets better once you get more skills to play with.',''),(2463,'Refunded because the camera kept spinning and looking up.

You play as Robocop and they have the sound effects and movement down to a tea. They also have the original voice of Robocop which is a nice touch. I would compare this game to the Terminator:Resistance game. Both fantastic for the nostalgia elements and fan base of either Robocop or Terminator. But the game itself isn\'t that well optimised and I personally don\'t think it is worth the £45 asking price. But you do get a solid 15+ hour story and campaign and a lot of fun. Just don\'t expect this game to be like a solid AAA FPS game. It isn\'t. I think most of the positive reviews are based on the nostalgic elements to the game, as opposed to the actual gameplay itself, but I had a good time in any case. For achievement hunters it is a very easy and straightforward 100% with nothing missable and the options to replay missions from certain points after completion.',''),(2471,'I like the game, but this comes with a huge caveat Aside from some minor performance issues I\'m happy with the opening of this title. It sets the scene well, it is very 80\'s retro-futuristic. Acting seems suitably camp, decent humour and the gameplay, while nothing groundbreaking, is perfectly fine.But this comes with a big negative.The game has no manual saving. That is fine in itself if autosaves were regular, such as time based, or picking up items, or starting/completing quests etc.But they are not. It appears to be on new area only. That means you could easily be forced to play for several hours between saves. Terminator included a half decent time based autosave as well as terminals here and there where a manual save can be dropped.Why not here? It is 2023, why have such a stupid autosave system?Heaven forbid real life gets in the way of playing a video game.Manual saving, if only in free roam and not in instanced missions, would simultaneously be a basic quality of life inclusion and an incredible addition.Quite honestly I am close to refunding, even if I do think the game is decent. I do not want to be at the whims of a video game dictating when I can and cannot shut it off without losing potentially hours of progress.Lack of manual saving is fine if autosaving is well implemented, and in this title it really isn\'t.Thumbs up for the game, but considering a refund because honestly that is such a poor mechanics choice.Edit: Putting in for a refund.I\'ve slept on it and yeah, putting in for a refund.Why? As enjoyable as I can tell the game is, even within the first 90 minutes, I really don\'t want to be held hostage (so to speak) in regards when I can and cannot switch the game off.It is such a simple and ridiculous oversight to not have better Autosaving Checkpoints if the game is void of a Manual Save function.Whether the zones are large or small I want to explore. I want to bumble around and look at the level design, all the little nods and jokes. I want to stumble across subquests, I want to take in the atmosphere. You cannot do that if you are constantly checking to see if the game is saved. As small as the world may be it is highly detailed and I just cannot freely explore it if you are pushed from checkpoint to checkpoint because you are afraid \"Real Life\" could get in the way any moment. Losing anywhere between 20 to 60 minutes worth of progress because I took my time to sight-see isn\'t an attractive prospect.The game itself is great, if you personally can work to the checkpoints you\'ll enjoy it. I can\'t guarantee my play sessions will suit the game, so yeah, requesting refund.Will pick this up again if they add in a basic quality of life improvement that has been built into  games since before Super Mario World on the SNES; the ability to save at will, or the reassurance of regular autosaving.',''),(2472,'Story:- Sticks with the original concepts of man vs. machine dilemma, juggling what\'s right vs. what\'s political convenient, and humanizes main characters and side characters. A- Full of choices, many of which have substantial impacts on story outcome.

This game is actually very fun and quite well done overall. I was pulled in from the first mission and have about 8 hours into this game so far across three play sessions. The gameplay is a bit simple, it\'s mostly a first person shooter but with some RPG elements for leveling up. You have your primary story missions which take 30-60 minutes on average to complete one. There is also quite a bit of side content that is also very well done and detailed, it doesn\'t feel tacked-on at all. I have enjoyed every one of the side-missions that I have played so far.The story takes place after the first Robocop film, and he is still dealing with various glitches in his programming as a subsequent result of being still somewhat human, despite being treated as if he is nothing more than a machine by OCP (the amoral corporation that owns the police, somehow, in this dystopian retro-future version of Detroit in the 1980s (or possibly 1990s, not sure which). Ultimately, the writing seems to be serviceable so far. Don\'t expect AAA-level writing and character development, but they do a good job building upon what was already in place from the first Robocop movie.I like to also touch on the technical aspects of a game when I review them, this one is pretty sound in the regard. Just be sure to understand that this game is using Unreal Engine 5, making use of Lumen (software-based ray tracing) for Global Illumination and Reflections (although Screen Space Reflections are used also), Nanite and Virtual Shadow Maps. My point is that the game is somewhat heavy, like all UE5 titles but visual fidelity is quite striking. Performance is pretty good on my desktop PC (System Specs on my Profile if you care). I have even completed a few levels on my Steam Deck, although I would not recommend buying this game if that is your only way to play it. You have to set everything to low, set FSR/TSR/XeSS upscaling to Balanced mode and you still aren\'t always at 30FPS. There are also some graphical glitches like characters appearing to be missing teeth and something weird with the normal maps on character models\' faces, it looks like something is wrong with their skin. This only happens on my Steam Deck, not my Windows PC. I don’t think that this is really a reflection of Teyon’s work, it’s just that the Steam Deck isn’t really fit for purpose when it comes to running the newest games striving for photorealism, they comes with a relatively demanding cost in terms of the necessary hardware to get a good experience. WARNING- Cloud Saves appear to be not working, I hope Teyon/Nacon fix this, because it is really annoying for people with multiple ways to play their Steam games. I\'m still gonna recommend this game but that could change later on if they don\'t patch it to support cloud saves later.',''),(2475,'It\'s impressive how much Teyon has improved since their attempt at a Rambo video game, which had to be among the worst video games of that decade. They showed a lot of improvement with their Terminator adaptation and have become even better now with this version of RoboCop, which pays a lot of homage to fans of the franchise and, surprisingly, actually stays accurate to the source material. And I bought this video game solely because it seemed to stay true to the roots of RoboCop. Yes, RoboCop is actually unapologetically white male as he should be. There\'s none of those blatant woke tropes that we often see in modern productions these days where people have to virtue signal every time you walk around a corner or load into a new cutscene. As they like to say, it feels good to be represented for once.The game is just pure fun and carnage as video games should be. Minor destructible environments such as being able to chip away at pillars, lots of gore which is reminiscent to the bloody mess that was the F.E.A.R franchise, and even a morality system where prominent NPCs will actually remember actions that you make or dialogue that you choose in response. There\'s a lot of content which surprised me, as I thought this was going to be a very short video game and that it might be too overpriced at $50 USD. It is still kind of short, though, so for a lot of people, $50 USD full price might seem too steep of a price tag for a singleplayer video game. But somewhere around 50 quests, split somewhat evenly between main missions and side missions? A fun RPG system that allows you to invest points into a character build as well as being able to upgrade your pistol efficiency? And a semi-open world where you have a lot of opportunity for exploration and easter egg hunting? That\'s pretty good for a AA video game title.You don\'t need to spend the extra $12 USD or so on the current DLC as these are just cosmetic packs, but I\'d recommend doing so just to support these developers in their journey to AAA status, as Robocop is a step in the right direction and I am holding onto hope that they can only continue to go up ever since their Rambo video game. On a sale? It\'s worth the buy even more so, especially for shooter game fans and Robocop fans in general. Maybe a Judge Dredd video game can be next.Things to dislike:-While I love the gunplay and the gore, the ragdolls need massive improvement. It is not at all realistic to the degree that you\'d find from games like Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto. Corpses are constantly contorted in an unrealistic way. I love ragdoll physics but the physics here are immersion breaking.-The psychology path in the skill tree needs reworking. It is fundamentally useless and a waste of points currently. Unless it was just bugged for me. I almost always focus on maximizing the skills that allows me access to more dialogue choices such as with Fallout, but with this game, you don\'t actually need to do anything but put two points into it to access ALL special dialogue choices, which are very minimal. I think I did every quest and talked to as many NPCs as I could find and I only remember seeing around three or so special \"psychology\" dialogue choices. It sounds important when you are researching the skills tab, but it truly isn\'t. As of now, I don\'t think there\'s any way to reset skills points, either. Which also needs to be added as it\'s become the norm in modern gaming for players to be given the freedom to explore different builds without needing to restart from the very beginning.-There needs to be a \"new game+\" mode so that people can re-experience the video game with the skills that they\'ve unlocked. Otherwise, XP needs to be given in greater values so that you level up more before the conclusion of the video game. There simply isn\'t enough to do in this game to maximize all of your character\'s skills. Crime evidence is littered throughout the maps, for example, and gives you a point value for collecting it but for many areas of the game, these points are redundant unless you have the quest for collecting a certain amount of crime evidence items, and this side quest doesn\'t exist in every map. I\'d suggest converting the arbitrary points value of these items into XP points instead. It\'d encourage players to find more of the secrets as well, because those stashes are otherwise pointless to look for since you are not actually being rewarded for it. -The music isn\'t all that great, especially during some of the more action packed sequences of the game. You\'d expect something way better than what they used. Something to get you pumped as a robotic cop dispensing deathly justice to all of the criminals and thugs. The music here seemed more like something you\'d hear from a Spider-Man game as you are swinging around the city or something. It\'s more peaceful, relaxing music rather than something that you\'d expect to play during a major boss battle.-The game needs a manual save feature or better auto-saving. I had to quit playing at some point and when I came back to it, I was like 10+ minutes behind from where I signed out. I can only imagine how far back you can go if you actually die. -Difficulty is a bit too easy, but that\'s just a personal gripe. Even on expert mode, I only died twice. And both instances were not even to the bosses, but because I was distracted by something else going on around me and looked away from my HP bar momentarily. Other than that, I really did enjoy the 14 or so hours I put into the game. I got all of the achievements in that time frame, and playing it on an easier difficulty probably means that you can beat it even faster so take that as you will for its price tag.',''),(2476,'A must-have for any 90\'s kid.

Buy it.They say, that the reason that I\'m not entranced with video games the same way I used to is that I\'ve gotten older. I just have more things to spend my spare time on. They say, games are simply not as interesting to mature adults with responsibilities. Mature adults with responsibilities live in the \"now\", not in some fantasy fairy tale.Well, this game proves them wrong. The contrast between Robocop and recent(ish) \"big\" games from \"AAA studios\" made me really question what modern gamedev has become. All these garbage games get presented in a pretty wrapper - and when you don\'t enjoy it - it\'s YOUR fault. You\'re the one that changed.It\'s not the endless grind for some random amount of whatever; it\'s not the superficial plotline or the boring fetch quests; it\'s not the collecting of a million somethings all around the map to get an achievement, that no one cares about; it\'s certainly not our f*cking in-game store, where you can buy a pretty picture for something that was intentionaly made plain. And it gets repeated so often, that you actually start to believe it. After Baldur\'s Gate 3 released they all whined \"oh, but we can\'t compete with that, look at how much time they spent on it...\". Well, maybe that\'s how it supposed to be? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, they should at least try! And it looks to me like this relatively small gamedev actually did try.Yeah, it crashed on me acouple of times. Yes, the lines are cheesy af. And yes, I\'ve rolled my eyes quite a bit at the plot, especially towards the end. The first time I started to robo-walk somewhere I couldn\'t believe they dared to release a game in 2023, where you are forced to walk THAT. F*CKING. SLOW.But release it they did. And you know what? I had fun.You walk into a mob of enemies and pull the trigger. Heads explode spectacularly. Blood all over the place. Polish it with a cheesy robo-line. Continue. Rinse. Repeat. But for some reason you don\'t tire of it. There are many variations of ugprades for Robocop\'s pistol. It can be made into a proverbial Super-Deagle or a full-auto SMG. It has infinite ammo. It kicks ass. There are different uprades for the Robocop - perks to give abilities or boost specs. They\'re cool. There are different weapons you can pick up from the enemies. Midgame and later you don\'t need them - your pistol is the sh*t.The small side-quests you get to do, the secondary characters you get to shape, locations that don\'t seem like it\'s all the one same place (even when it is, lol), the ridiculous sh*t npcs sometimes say - it all somehow adds up into a very engaging experience...And now, that you\'ve read to down here - if you\'re still with me - I\'ve never seen a single Robocop movie :D ... But I absolutely adored this game.Yeah, maybe it isn\'t the polished triple-A experience, that we are so used to nowadays. But, perhaps, it shouldn\'t be? It\'s simply good the way it is, flaws and all.I guess that\'s what really brought on my existential mid-life venting - Robocop ignores quite a bit of mordern gamedev concepts. But, right off you can tell, that these guys had put their hearts into the game - and, suprisingly, it turns out, that that\'s enough.A rare gem in a sea of soulless trash.',''),(2485,'I\'m not even invested in the Robocop franchise, I still had a really good time in this game. While there are some negatives, over all the game is really good.GraphicsGraphics are a bit mixed but good most of the time. They really did nail the look and moves of Robocop. Happened twice that the framerate almost grinded to a halt while playing. Had to restart the game to fix it. Facial animations look a bit stiff but it looks ok. The reflections on the ground look weird on the wet asphalt. If you move your mouse in a circle while the asphalt is visible you will see what I mean. The reflections will get this weird white noise but will start calming down once you stop moving your mouse, it\'s like the ground is anxious or something.MissionsMostly they were good and entertaining. What bothered me the most is that they put you in a smaller sandbox with a main objective and expect you to stomp around all over town to find all other hidden side objectives, they expect you to do this multiple times in the same sandbox as well. Imagine going back to the police station and getting \"You didn\'t save the hostages\". What hostages? No one called the cops? At least give me an area to investigate so I don\'t miss stuff like this by mistake. Later in the game the citizens have no problem calling the cops and asking for help. Why couldn\'t they ask for help earlier in the game?DifficultyPlayed this game on hard and most of the time the game was kind of easy. There was a very distinguished difficulty spike with a boss (first time you meet ed 209), except for that It mostly felt like I was OP. If you are used to playing on hard I would recommend playing on harder difficulty.WeaponsThe gun you get is really good, you get to mod it etc. While the modding wasn\'t very intuitive to begin with you get used to it quickly. My biggest issue is the way you combine circuits and just get random stuff. Can be really annoying when you want a part that is shaped in a certain way and the RNG just never gives it to you.Some of the effects are a bit confusing too. I picked an upgrade that was supposed to give me \"MASSIVE DAMAGE\" but it also resulted me in getting a penalty of 20%. So was this a good or bad thing?The stats look worse and the \"MASSIVE DAMAGE\" doesn\'t really show up anywhere. Well, I got \"MASSIVE DAMAGE\" so it was worth it but it wasn\'t clear.What about other weapons? Didn\'t really feel like it was worth using other weapons. I used some early on but it didn\'t feel like it was worth picking any up since your starter gun gets really good with upgrades. You also need to constantly pick up ammo and you can only have about 2 mags on you for the other weapon.Think I will just use my gun with infinite ammo and press down left mouse instead.Might sound negative but again, I had a really good time with this game. It\'s so nice being able to play single player games like it\'s the early 2000 again. Really surprised haven\'t heard more about this game.Another thing I have to give this game is the destructibility of the environment. Feels really nice seeing an area transform into a war zone.EDIT:This is after viewing all Robocop movies. This is like an alternative timeline in the Robocop franchise with the exclusion from the 2014 movie (reboot) and most inspiration coming from Robocop 1 and 2 (the best ones).They made something new but it still feels like it stays true to the source material without stepping on fans feet which can be a very hard thing to do now. I know people have complained about the gun sound but it didn\'t really bother me that much. They have of course made some changes, for example they didn\'t replicate the terrible uncanny valley face animations from the evil robot in robocop 2 (which is a good thing).I can appreciate the game much more now after watching robocop 1 and 2. This is a great re-imagination of an old franchise in form of a game.',''),(2486,'Incredible experience and immersion in the RoboCop world. I had a ton of fun and laughs with the side and main quests, there was never a dull moment. Hoping we eventually get a new game plus with more fun side quests, maybe RoboCop will get to adopt a cat.

Anyhow fantastic job by the devs!',''),(2487,'There are a few shortcomings, in an entire playthrough I had 3 crashes, there\'s no dedicated button to spin your pistol, that\'s about it.

Despite it feeling like a Saturday morning cartoon at times, I\'d give the story a 7~/10.That being said, this game just, really f*cking cool. It makes generally uninteresting things like commuting, texting in a group chat, and even opening an umbrella feel buttery-f*cking-smooth. The UI, the music, just playing this game feels really good.

The story is pretty enjoyable although it has its ups and downs but when it hits hard, it hits hard. The whole game is like a rollercoaster, you just hop on it and enjoy the ride. Overview You play as Ren Amamiya (or the MC which you can name him however you want), who got falsely convicted of a crime, ends up with a one-year probation sentence and had to move to Tokyo to attend at Shujin Academy. However, you awaken your powers which is called \"Persona\", you and your friends use your new powers to try changing society for the better. The Story Is it life-changing? No.Is it long? Yes, it is kinda dragged on a bit but the game does a great job at sucking you into it\'s world and characters, you won\'t feel that the game is long because you are having fun and enjoying the game.Is it entertaining? Yup. The Gameplay The gameplay consists of you going to school to live a normal student life and dungeon-crawling.I love that the game\'s version of going outside and touching grass is pretty freaking entertaining which makes you want to forget about the real world. Like say, your friends invite you to go out for a drink and you say that you’re busy, but you’re actually playing P5R and you want to hang out with your pal Ryuji instead.The dungeons are well made, except for THAT one dungeon of course.The combat is turn-based and some of you may don’t like it, but honestly it is pretty damn fun. It’s like pokemon where you deal more damage by hitting the enemy’s weaknesses, but you knock the enemies all down by doing that and perform a stylish beatdown afterwards. I want to say more about the combat but it is best that you experience it for yourself.The soundtrack is incredible and it is a work of art. Some of my favorite tracks are Life Will Change, Beneath The Mask, Rivers in the Desert and I Believe. What The Royal Version Offers - Quality of life changes (pretty good)- A new dungeon which consists an extra 20 hours of playtime- 2 brand new characters with new story too- One new location- New activities Conclusion The game is amazing, and you should give it a try if you have the chance.

This review will assume you\'ve either played the original or are unbothered by minor mechanical and story spoilers. These are the main differences between the the original and the remake:- Improved visuals - Issac now has a voice, the character did not speak at all in the first game. Dead Space 2 was when he got a voice.- The limb system is improved, flesh will tear off the bone before more force is required to maim a necromorph.- Upgrades are slightly different, arguably improved- Some of the puzzles are different, for instance that horrible sequence where the ADS cannons are offline in the original is dramatically improved.Tech and PerformanceOn the following specs I was able to run the game at the high preset at 1440p around 50-90FPS.

Of course this is difficult to achieve having played the other two games numerous times.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3121665732The one improvement I wished was in the remake is the ability to alter what the locator is looking for. Such that you\'re able to find benches, stores or save stations easier.There are other differences as well such as needing security clearance to open certain lockers or storage units. You won\'t miss them, it\'s part of the story. Previously, you would have needed to use a power node to open [optional] doors. A resource used otherwise to upgrade weapons or your suit. Kind of like using a shiv in the Last of Us to open doors.The GistThis is a great remake, if it doesn\'t inspire Dead Space 2 and 3 to also get remade I hope at the very least in reignites interest in the franchise and Dead Space 4 gets made.If you\'ve found this review helpful, consider following my curation — Station ArgusSemi-Unrelated: Using genre tags and nomenclature of labelsThere are many people that describe this series as “Survival Horror”. And they also say that Dead Space 3 specifically strays from this path becoming an “action” game. Well, I\'ve got news for those people, Dead Space was always an action game — just set with a horror aesthetic and theme. What I believe people intend on conveying when they say “survival horror” is that there is resource scarcity that requires management that makes combat more difficult. Which is not untrue of Dead Space, but on the medium difficulty there\'s nearly no place where you won\'t have health packs or ammo. In my understanding, the term “survival” — at least in regards to genre tags — implies there is something akin to tending to needs like hunger, thirst, sleep, etc. But for whatever reason, the survival part of “survival horror” seems to only be used in the more traditional sense. The sense where you are trying to not die. Which can be applied to a considerably large number of games. In any case, I consider the Dead Space series, or games like Resident Evil 4 and older to be action games set in a horror theme. The original 3 Resident Evil games, not the remakes, are what I truly think of when the term Survival Horror is used — \'tank\' controls, inability to aim precisely and fixed cameras.

Despite multiple attempts, I have encountered challenges in seeking a resolution for an issue that has greatly affected my gaming experience.My disappointment stems from the current refund process, which appears to be governed by an automated system rather than a thorough consideration of individual cases. Upon examining my game time and achievements, it becomes evident that the title in question is, regrettably, plagued with technical issues, rendering it nearly unplayable. This is further echoed in the reviews provided by a significant portion of players who have encountered similar crashes and bugs.While I understand and respect the time constraints outlined for refunds, I am slightly beyond the stipulated three-hour limit due to persistent attempts to navigate through these technical impediments. I am earnestly seeking your understanding and support in this matter by facilitating a refund. My intention is not merely to retract the purchase but to reinvest the credit in a more polished gaming experience—one that aligns more closely with my expectations.Despite patiently awaiting an update or patch from EA, it is disheartening to note the absence of any significant remedial action over the past few months. The lack of resolution has led me to explore alternative avenues for addressing this issue, as it significantly impacts my enjoyment and satisfaction as a customer.I kindly implore you to reconsider my request for a refund, allowing me the opportunity to choose a game that offers a more fulfilling and functional experience. Your assistance in resolving this matter amicably would be greatly appreciated.

I never played the original Dead Space so I can\'t judge it in terms of that, but I can say this remake is pretty awesome.In fact, the only Dead Space game that I\'ve played before this was Dead Space 3 which is a less than terrifying co-op shooter. That experience did not prepare me at all for this. There\'s only one way to kill the monsters in this game. We\'re talking Total Dismemberment. Hands, arms, legs and, of course, heads will roll. It\'s something else. You\'ll \"kill\" critters only to see them get back up. Issac has to stomp the crap out of their bodies to make sure. It\'s gory and often terrifying. No, Dead Space 3 did not help prepare me at all.Dead Space is one of those Alien or Event Horizon ordeals where a Spaceship doubles as a haunted house. In this case it\'s the USG Ishimura, a gigantic mining vessel which just happens to have huge medical research facilities, a gargantuan hydroponics farm, a space basketball court, etc. Ishimura is the star of the show (well, other than the monkey stomp corpse button). It is huge and full of places for monsters to drop out of the ceiling. Your constantly running across the ship taking care of various objectives like \"do a spacewalk to fix our anti asteroid batteries while monsters try to cut your head off,\" or \"stop a nuclear bomb from detonating and destroying the ship while monsters try to cut your head off,\" or \"save us from poison gas by flushing a big monster into the great toilet that is outer space while other monsters try to cut your head off.\" It all flows together very well and the pacing is first rate.I liked it a lot and it makes me wish I\'d played the original.

I\'m trying different ways now to restore at least my recent savegame, but I fear the damage is done.The game is an okay remake. Graphics are definitely an improvement and the game has some decent quality of life gameplay improvements, like Isaac\'s smoother controls and the \"open-worldish\" interconnections between the levels. In my opinion the Zero-Gravity gameplay was done a tad better in the older Dead Space 2 and 3.

I would recommend waiting until the game is fully released with all of its DLCs *on* *sale* to buy it. To me there was just not enough there to justify the price. It feels like a game that\'s only had a few years of development rather than seven and it\'s just kind of under cooked.The game itself is just boring and uninspired. It\'s sterile and safe, built to appeal to the widest possible audience and not offend anybody. The characters sometimes have their shining moments but for the most part are bland and your companions are the worst of these offenders because they all have the same opinion on everything, they\'re all the same. The characters also don\'t look great, they have this dead eyed uncanny valley effect to them made worse by the skyrim style zoom in whenever they talk. The quests themselves with the exception of a few, are so uninspired and boring and offer no moral dilemmas or require any serious thought. Compare the Ryujin quest line to the thieves guild quest line in Oblivion. With the thieves guild quest like there is a gradual progression which teaches the player not only how to be a thief but what to expect as far as how challenging a given assignment will be. Ryujin gives you three childishly easy quests that are so easy that they neither teach you how to be a thief nor give you an idea of what\'s to come then the difficulty meter suddenly jumps with the next quest to really quite difficult. Thankfully I happened to have enough levels saved up to dump some points into stealth otherwise I would have had to fail or just leave the quest, level up, and come back. This quest comparison also highlights another issue because Ryujin takes place in one of the saddest areas in the game, Neon.Locations. What is Bethesdas engine really good at? It makes it relatively easy to hand craft huge worlds. So what does Starfield do? They hand crafted a few locations and left the rest up to procedural generation of course!... Oh, well... the few hand crafted locations are great right? No? Oh okay then. New Atlantis is kinda cool but it\'s so small, it\'s close to having some literal and figurative depth to it with the well but that\'s barely explored. New Akila looks cool but again is far too small. The Key is not a city. And Neon... Oh Jesus Christ Neon...Neon is \"we have Nightcity from CP2077 at home.\" It\'s suppose to be this cyberpunk, blade runner-esque city rampant with crime and drug use. You basically get the DisneyLand (not even DisneyWorld) version of that. There is no crime to witness. There are no daily schedules like Oblivion npcs had. Just the same blank faces staring at you like your ♥♥♥♥ is out but you don\'t know it like all the other cities. They hype up a drug that can only be bought in a particular very talked up club in Neon and the club is one of the saddest things i\'ve ever seen in a game. It\'s one relatively tiny room with flashing neon lights and out of shape spandex wearing conehead cosplayers gyrating uncomfortably. Keep in mind this is one of the few hand crafted locations, pretty much everything else is procedurally generated. You also can\'t even smuggle the drug out for any profit, it\'s worth the same no matter what planet you bring it to which doesn\'t make any sense. So locations are not great which brings me to exploration...Exploration in Starfield is not great. In a Fallout or an Elder Scrolls game you can stumble upon countless interesting hand crafted locations and encounters in the game to the point that getting lost is a good thing. In Starfield you won\'t stumble upon anything because you fast travel from planet to planet, system to system. So to explore that has to be your express goal. Okay, fine. Except everything is procedurally generated so after you\'ve done it once you\'re just going to see it copy and pasted on different looking planets. You\'re not going to find anything new in that cave because it\'s the same cave. You\'re not going to find anything interesting on that planet because it\'s going to have the same stuff as the last one, just with different plants around it and the grounds a different color. Just go system to system looking for content until you get bored with that. They made some decent random encounters that you can have while out in space but not enough of them, I\'ve run into Grandma half a dozen times by now.And as far as things to do... the ending: Spoilers ahead obviously. It\'s another multiverse story. I understand 7 years ago when the game began development this concept wasn\'t quite as tired and cliche as it has become but good God am I sick of multiverses. The whole point of the game is to just replay it again, that\'s how it ends. I wish I was joking. It\'s message is basically it\'s not about the destination, it\'s about the journey, which is fine but the journey is not good... Unfortunately the game has, to me, no replayability until new content in the form of DLC drops. Which I may not even buy until it goes on sale because I just don\'t care. The story is that uninteresting. This is not to say that everything about Starfield is bad. The gun play is actually pretty great though not worth it alone to buy the game. The ship building is actually really fun despite it being janky, probably some of the most fun i\'ve had in the game. Some of the quests are fun like the UC quest line and other shorter, one off quests. They all have the same problems though: if they do offer any interesting ideas they do not fully explore them, they acknowledge them and that\'s about it. Things like the Well, tensions between the UC and Rangers, and the UC being a fascist state are all explored in only the most superficial terms. Bethesda has always had the problem of being wide as a lake but deep as a puddle and Starfield is unfortunately a prime example of how this problem has only gotten worse with every subsequent Bethesda release since Morrowind. I did enjoy parts of this game but I cannot recommend it for $70. It is so frustrating to see Bethesda finally get a crack at creating a unique IP that isn\'t another Elder Scrolls or Fallout game and they make this boring, uninspired whimper of a game. This game is all of Bethesdas bad habits, everything they\'re bad at and nothing they\'re good at, finely distilled. One of the most frustrating things to me is that this game is mediocre, it\'s not bad like No Mans Sky and it didn\'t ruin Bethesdas reputation like CP2077 did on release so it\'s not going to get the attention it needs to be made into great game like those studios did. Chances are post launch will be handled very much like FO4 where we\'ll get a couple of bug fixes but not nearly enough and a couple of nickle and dime DLCS then one or two really solid ones.

I\'m at a loss to comprehend Bethesda\'s direction. In an era graced by masterpieces like Cyberpunk 2077, Red Dead Redemption II, Elden Ring, and Baldur\'s Gate, Bethesda has somehow managed to release a game that feels archaic, lackluster, and painfully underwhelming. The game\'s script is lackadaisical, the gameplay lethargic, and the overall experience is profoundly uninspiring. It\'s a far cry from the innovative standards set in 2023/24.This weekend, as I pen this review, the player counts speak volumes:Starfield: 20,027 playersFallout 4: 20,089 playersSkyrim SE: 23,723 playersThese figures paint a grim picture for Bethesda. It took them eight years to produce a game that not only fails to surpass but barely matches the engagement of their older titles. A \"Fallout 4 - Space Edition\" or a substantial DLC would have likely been a more successful venture.I played Starfield for a mere 8 hours, enough to confirm the myriad issues highlighted in other reviews. I refuse to waste more time on a game that has left me, a long-time Bethesda admirer, deeply disappointed, frustrated, and saddened. There\'s no incentive for me to invest my creativity in playing or modding Starfield.Bethesda, this is a farewell from a disheartened fan.

So many gameplay elements/mechanics have been removed:Can\'t craft armor/weapons/ammo. You can\'t modify melee weapons. Weapon mods are no longer items that can be transferred from one weapon to another.Combat is the bare minimum. There are no \"special\" weapons. They had a golden opportunity to create new weapons designed for fighting aboard spaceships (which you really don\'t want to damage while you\'re inside one...) and in zero-g, and they squandered it.NPCs no longer have their equipped armor/clothing in their inventory, and it can\'t be removed from them.There are no traps (tripwires, tension triggers, pressure plates, noisemakers, etc.)NPCs are less interactive than what GTA 4 accomplished more than a decade ago. In Skyrim, when you used your special powers, npcs would be amazed or frightened, and guards would scold you for disturbing the peace. In Starfield, no one even seems to notice unless you hurt someone with it.Companions can no longer be given orders to move to specific places, or interact with things, or loot containers, or attack specific enemies. You can tell them to wait and carry items, that\'s it.No gore/dismemberment.No limb crippling.No reverse pickpocketing.This is all stuff that players should be able to take for granted from a Bethesda game like this, because they\'ve already done it before!',''),(2535,'I have 270 hours and 3 new game pluses under my belt. This game has UI, starship and outpost building, and character growth issues (tied to story). It\'s like playing a vanilla skyrim or Fallout 4, but without the epic storytelling those two had. Unfortunately at the end of the day, this story telling just falls flat. There are not enough branching options and nuances that make it worth it. These are things the community has polished and are tired of polishing. That is why the game is a let down. We\'re playing a game and once again having to fix things \'we\' always have to fix. Where is the maturity? where is the polish from a mature game studio? Why are we needing quality of life and literal math calculation fixes from broken elements of the game in the first month while the studio is silent , scrambling to correct graphics options that should have been present day one? (really, no functional HDR or DLSS support when you could probably train a chimp to read steam hardware survey results and know nvidia cards are king in the marketspace)It\'s a disappointment not because the game is bad, its a disappointment -because it\'s a Bethesda game like we\'ve always come to expect- and honestly, its 2023, the world has seen some poop in the last few years, and it\'s nobody wants to accept a vanilla skyrim or fallout 4 experience. It\'s borderline disrespectful to the community to not bake-in the refinements of elements from these games of the past to learn from those. You can tell no one on this dev team played fallout 4 or skyrim with 100+ mods, and if they did, they were just too afraid, too soft, or not skilled or trained enough to be in a culture where they can provide negative feedback and have that be a healthy interaction with their peers and their managers to speak up and say \'this isn\'t right\'.Overall, i rate the game 6.5 / 10 and say It probably needs another year and some of the story retconned, and the world livened up. I would like to see faster paced ship combat and slower paced ship combat based on ship size (ship of the line vs. dogfighting), UI and inventory management polish, better character progression, better and more ship customization features , more control over ladders and connecting spaces between ship parts, better Outpost object clearing (sometimes rocks just turn invisible instead of being properly removed when i place an outpost item over them so suddenly i have invisible walls), Reduced and smarter random spawns of ground locations (random spaceports and other points of interest on planetary maps) It\'s incredibly disappointing to land on a planet that looks desolate and, without fail, always see some human-made building within sight because the algorhyhm says there needs to be one. Spoiler: this even happens on the planet during Sara\'s companion mission if you walk about 1k meters ish outside the hand crafted landscape. Seriously immersion breaking and ruins that bit of story.In the end, I think people will be playing starfield in 11 years but not because they played all 11 years, but because they waited another 2-3 years , an apology and a free DLC that lured them back in. I doubt they can pull a CDPR cyberpunk though. It\'s kind of sad, because the dev\'s failure on this is also a sign of disrespect to themselves after they complained about TES and FO series and wanted something new. Here is their new IP, their new story and opportunity for world building and it\'s just a let down...Yeah I played 270 hours, but I really only needed 40. Some questlines are vastly more enjoyable than others despite being optional ( and thats cool ) but geez. I\'ll never pick the game up again for probably a year or two, and i\'ll -never- purchase DLC or expansions for the game unless I get the equivalent of content and updates of one DLC / expansion\'s worth of free updates that show they have the passion to at least fight for their respect again.',''),(2536,'Midfield',''),(2537,'Decent game but I think I expected a bit more from it. There is not enough depth to the game and the planets are a little lifeless. I can see this game being massively better in the future after many updates and possible DLC\'s, along with the modding community. But it feels a little empty right now and lacks a bit of replay-ability.I think it would have been better to add half a dozen incredibly detailed planets which you could become fully immersed in, as opposed to hundreds of lifeless planets. Crafting and base building is on the whole, a little pointless unless you are focused on XP grinding and weapon upgrades, but the upgrades you can add to weapons make hardly any difference. The 100% is easy but can be a grind depending on how you play this game. The only missable achievement as far as I know is getting a companion to full likeability/marrying them. This will take most of an entire campaign playthrough and you should really just keep one of the companions at all times.On the whole, I enjoyed the game but I expected more from Bethesda considering how long this game was supposedly in development.',''),(2538,'If you\'re looking for a \"play once\" game, then Starfield will meet your needs.  It\'s okay for a one time playthrough.  Once I had done all the quests, played through all the NGs, struggled through the janky outpost building, crafted quite a few ships (as well as stealing lots of them), and explored all of the star systems, I was done.  I even tried my hand at roleplaying by pretending the first hour and a half of the game never happened and plopping my character in a certain locale, then ridding myself of all possessions and pretending I didn\'t have a ship.  But the game dialogue and the choices the player is forced to make really made it difficult.  I was also really disappointed with the companions available.  Sarah was like a scolding mother.  Barrett was just ludicrous.  Sam had a child--seriously?--and a child does not belong on my ship.  She and Sam would strike up conversations in the middle of battle and make it really hard to concentrate.  Andreja was the best, and I lost her when the Hunter attacked.  That was a real downer, and I don\'t play games to be sad.So, if you want a real RPG--go back to Skyrim.  If you want to build, go back to Fallout 4.  That\'s where I\'ll spend most of my time now.  Starfield is not bad, but it\'s not what I was expecting.  I was really happy with it at first--but then I was just bored and sad.  I really hope BGS spends some time improving it.  I know that\'s expecting a lot, but if they want it to be playable for the next ten years, that\'s what needs to happen.',''),(2539,'Loading screens simulator, I played this after BG3, liked had a gourmet dish for lunch then went Mcdonald for dinner.-Everything fell bland, out of date, nothing stand out from story, character, combat...etc. -Loading screen even enter 1x1 room?

To put it bluntly , this game could have been so much more .',''),(2541,'I have toyed between liking and not liking this game for a very long time. I saw it was met with a mountain of hate, and I\'d been able to embrace some flawed games in the past. Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Mirror\'s Edge Catalyst, Mass Effect Andromeda. I had to get my own opinion on this. Running endlessly on planets is horrific, but I could fix it with the Jetpack Overhaul mod and the gunplay was satisfying. The quests in the game just weren\'t gripping me, but maybe I could invest past the lack of voice acting and body language and into the words and meanings, and hey you can build really cool, livable, usable starships! Then something broke in me. When I finally reached a certain point in the story quest, all the effort I put into levelling my character and starships all suddenly felt pointless. It was in that moment it truly clicked with me that I was playing a soulless game.Like the pot boiling the frog you can\'t quite notice it at first. One distraction after another when you land on another barren planet, a dopamine-producing alien killing gunspree later, and ooh maybe that 1 promising outpost in the distance could have cool enemies, a horrifying back story, or great items? Ah it was just enemies in a maze-like interior. And oh there\'s another over there, I wonder if it\'s any different! Eventually, you learn to never touch them again, short of if you want to specifically grind for experience points or better weapon tiers, and even then you\'re better off running around killing wild aliens for XP, which by the way level you 10x faster than any other method.That\'s what 100 hours in this game was for me. Creating that awesome starship I always wanted to, calculating the best weapons and mass distribution I can put on it. Chasing down resources to create experimental weapon mods on every new weapon I picked up. That kind of felt... *fun*?And then || after a... I think, *exciting*? Main story mission where Walter and I negotiated with an ex-employee for an artifact in Neon, I met the Starborn. What followed was what I can only describe was as if a Redditor was given the task of writing about a new, illusive, dominating alien race making first contact, and that Redditor clearly being a fan of Mass Effect. After some of the most clunky dialogue exchange between you, the Starborn, and your companions, you\'re able to fight this \"ship design you\'ve never seen before\" who is prepared to \"send you into oblivion\", who I immediately trounced and who had only escaped with a smidge of health because I attempted to disable its engines, to which I discovered you can\'t dock it anyway. ||I think that\'s what\'s shallowly buried beneath the lines here. It\'s that constant theme in Starfield where something promising shows itself, where it be a mechanic, a new world, the NASA punk art style and sounds, or embers of a space epic story, and then you\'re very quickly met with a hollow, just slightly stimulating experience so as to keep your head numb and stop you from realizing what\'s really going on. Playing this game feels like undergoing the processes of indoctrination, but in real life.That dialogue sequence though. That one dialogue sequence. It triggered memories it should not have. As soon as I remembered the intense feelings I felt during the Mass Effect trilogy, and just how harrowing it was to meet a Reaper for the first time, I snapped out of my stupor and realized how dry my throat has been for soulful story experiences that have real emotion, voice acting, and charisma.This game lacks all of it, it has no charm. And when you realize it, every effort you put into your action RPG pseudo-roleplay that they\'ve engineered you into comes tumbling down like the weak house of cards it is. The only winning move is never to play. I used to think it was the most mixed gameplay experience I have ever had. Now I can only see it as... a husk of a video game.There is one thing that this game gave me that I\'m truly grateful for. It has helped me realize what I truly value in a game - and what that actually looks like. I\'m off to escape my indoctrination before it\'s too late. I\'ll be starting the Outer Wilds and Baldur\'s Gate 3 now.',''),(2542,'I really, really wanted to like Starfield.  I own every Bethesda title, and considered myself a fanboy. But damn, has this game ruined that for me.On the surface, this game looks like your traditional Bethesda title. But once you get in the game, you quickly realize that the soul the other games have is missing here.  The carefully hand crafted points of interest found in the likes of Elder Scrolls and the Fallout franchise are few and far between in Starfield, in their place are you will find cut and paste points of interest with little to no environmental story telling. This story telling is what made the points of interest, interesting, without them it\'s simply boring.  Before this game, I used to let myself wander and explore Bethesda titles to see what I would find just over that next ridge, or around the next corner.   In Starfield, you either find nothing, or worse yet, a cardboard cutout of what could have been.The main quest line... where to begin.  The biggest questions posed by the events of the main quest line are NEVER answered and the new game plus aspect of the game loop makes me have Groundhog Day flashbacks. The Main Companions... There are only two companions in this game that I even remotely like.  Vasco, and Sam. The others have either nagging, loud, or otherwise obnoxious personalities.  And all of them are \"Good Guys\" so if you want to play a bad guy, you can forget about having them with you.The Powers... The superpowers you get in this game feel like re-skinned dragon shouts from Skyrim.  Hell, when I hit the first temple in the game, and got my first power, I wasn\'t excited, I felt let down because it -FELT- like learning a dragon shout in skyrim.   Same system, Same mechanic, Same effects, Different skin.The Ships...  When we were told we could navigate the galaxy, and could land on planets.. I was expecting something like Elite Dangerous, where you actually PILOTED the ship all the way down to until on the ground.  Instead we get loading cut scenes.  If you want a true space sim, get Elite or something similar.  This will game will leave you wanting.   Although, I got to had it to them, the space combat is fun, so is the ability to hijack ships...   Would be nice if we had to repel enemy boarding parties every now and then tho. Ship Building... The modular design of ships is cleaver but the builder is not fully fleshed out.  The U.I. is clunky, you can\'t rotate all modules, and you have zero control over the placement of doors and ladders. Travel... In Space, it\'s 90% menu and fast travel.  On Ground, it\'s 90% walking simulator with occasional bouts of fast travel.  There\'s a reason this game has gotten the nick-name Snorefield. The Factions...  The factions don\'t care weather you work with the other factions.  You can work with the police equivalent, and the pirates won\'t even bat an eye.  You can work with the rebels, and the organized government just shrugs.  Your alliances do not matter in this game.  In prior Bethesda titles, at least when you allied yourself with a faction, their enemies no longer trusted you.  In this title, they don\'t give a damn.Base Building ... If you\'ve played Fallout 4, or Fallout 76, you pretty much know what you\'re in for.  It can be fun, but the building system is janky at times.  Oh, and if you do wind up buying this game, watch tutorial videos, or you\'ll never get the supply lines stuff working properly. Over All ..  My advice to prospective buyers, wait for patches, and dlc before buying, wait for the creation kit to be released so modders have the proper tools to fix some of the issues with the game.   Because right now, this game is not worth 50 US Dollars.  It has too many bugs, and not enough soul.',''),(2543,'Boring, souless game. Took the one thing fun in Bethesda games, exploration, and replaced it by copy pasted, repetitive mini dungeons. Do not buy',''),(2544,'Just buy cyberpunk',''),(2545,'Sadly, I just uninstalled Starfield. I\'ll likely never play it again.I really liked Fallout 4, and still spin it up for another modded playthrough from time to time. Skyrim was one of my favorite games of all time. I also have fond memories of Morrowind, a game that got me hooked on the open world RPG genre. I also generally like space games, such as Mass Effect. I thus expected to fall in love with Starfield. In fact, I was so hyped for this game, I timed the purchase of a $10,000 PC and a 48 inch OLED display so as to have Starfield as my first gaming experience on the new rig and to enjoy everything the game had to offer under the best possible circumstances.Even after a few hours of pondering, I am still finding it hard to describe just how much I dislike Starfield and the depth of my disappointment, but I\'ll try.The list of small gripes is a mile long. Far too long for a comprehensive list in a short review, and rehashing the obvious likely adds little to the conversation. To mention just a few, these include a clunky UI, ridiculously low inventory space, absurdly low vendor cash even at major space ports, and the notorious plethora of loading screens. Normally, I hold off on modding a Bethesda game until I\'ve had at least one full playthrough and sink a few hundred hours into a vanilla experience. In this case, the mechanics grew so painful after only a few hours, I rushed over to Nexus to see if I could salvage any enjoyment from a game that I very much wanted to like. Several hours into the modded experience, with many quality of life issues mitigated, it dawned on me that no mods would likely ever fix the game\'s real flaws.I found myself desperately waiting for any sort of hook that would get me even remotely interested in this world. The game intro was by far the most banal of all Bethesda games that I\'ve ever played. I started off bored, and that boredom only grew with each passing hour. By the time I was only 15 hours in, I simply couldn\'t take it any more. Wandering through such an uninspired view of humanity\'s future left me feeling almost disembodied. I felt like neither I, nor my avatar, was actually part of the world. What\'s more, each part of the universe, and even every game mechanic felt oddly disjointed. Nothing jelled and very little made sense.I\'ve designed fantasy worlds from the time I was in middle school, creating custom campaigns for my friends to explore. As I learned to program, I then tried my hand at text adventure games and on and on it went. World building is hard. Certainly, not all of my attempts were successful masterpieces, but I\'d like to think that my skills have grown over the decades. The world of Starfield serves as a near perfect example of a disjointed, illogical, boring, uninspired, and nonsensical universe. I am very literally considering using it as an example of poor world building in my computer science course. Top that off with (mostly) bland dialog, illusionary player choices, dull worlds filled with endless procedural voids with slow traversal, AI that doesn\'t even match Bethesda\'s previous titles, and one is left with a meaningless shell of a game.',''),(2546,'I am a huge BGS and Sci-Fi fan, easily 2k hours in their games since I first played Oblvion on the Xbox360. This game should be a free win in my book and here are my spoiler free thoughts on why that is not the case. Playing this game felt like returning home, but some one stole all the furniture and replaced each piece with the same ugly, boring chair. Bethesda has not evolved at all and in fact has regressed by having these barren planets with copy paste dungeons, which unironically they couldn\'t even move the furniture around, it is literally copy paste. Those unique encounters and moments of world building hardly exist in this vacuum of space. The game mostly feels like an empty sandbox, which pales in comparison to No Man’s Sky and not a living breathing world like Fallout or The Elderscrolls. They claim that is by design, but it is not backed up immersively or mechanically. For the player it just means navigating menus since ship travel might as well not exist, then holding W key for 5 minutes until you find the same copy pasted dungeon on a slightly different colored rock from the last one. Shallow survival mechanics, no alternate methods of travel, boring points of interest,  and the only reason to explore a planet is for a few credits. They do not even have an encyclopedia to document your discoveries. They spent so much effort going for realism even the planets just look earthy with some oversized copy paste fauna strewn about them. When I play Bethesda games It is like going to a different world I can live in, Starfield just feels like a bunch of disconnected rocks I need to fast travel to. The planet exploration is about as bad as the original Mass Effects, which is fine if that is secondary to the game being a great RPG. The thing is Starfield is a fine looter shooter from the last console generation. I wouldn’t call it unfair or unfortantue since Bethsda did this to themselves, but I played this game inbetween Baldur\'s Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. Those two games in every way blow Starfield out of the water. Starfields conversations always feel disjointed and ignore the players choices, background, and experiences in the world. Which is immersion breaking in its own write but then It is coupled with creepy, dead NPCs and dated presentation. I remember feeling actually offended when I got to Neon; I tell the guard I am a neon street rat and the very next line of dialogue they forget that fact and start talking to me like it is my first visit to the planet. The game just feels very on rails and the players story comes second to the one Bethesda is trying to tell, which Is pretty boring in its own right. Most conversations just feel like a huge let down compared to other RPGs. Then we have the persuasion system which does not even come up very often, but when it does it feels so goofy and disjointed. It is literally the Oblvion persuasion system, canned responses from the NPCs and all. Roleplaying is weak in the conversation department how does it stack up gameplay wise? Well the skill tree feels like a watered down version of Fallout 4s and does not have a real impact on gameplay outside of a few key abilities that should not even be locked behind a skill tree. At its core the gameplay can actually be fun. The shooting is better than it ever has been and actually feels tight, responsive and punchy. There is a good variety of guns too even though energy weapons exist for no reason beyond a one minute section in a single mission.  I enjoyed jetpacking around blasting people. The problem is the people themselves. You will mostly be blasting one of three factions of dudes in space suits in different copy paste dungeons. Unfortunately these dudes have negative AI and present zero challenge for the player. After a while it feels like your are just blasting empty space suits devoid of sentient life, especially since there is no Fallout gore or gibbing in this game. I need those critical gibs Todd. I am no stranger to exploiting Bethesda’s lack luster AI, but this feels the worse out of all their games. Companions….well the 4 real companions are milktoast whiteknights with no moral complexity. Honestly they are just kinda boring nerds. The rest are just there to afk at an inferior outpost system to Fallout 4s settlements. One thing I did really enjoy besides going full Frank Reynolds is the ship building. It is really cool building your ship and dogfighting in space. It actually gives a reason to grind currency that has been missing since Morrowind. Unfortunately even being my favorite part of the game it is mired with issues. Chiefly among them is the restrictions, you must build in a small box, your exterior paint options are limited, no decals, you can not view or even change the interiors outside of selecting between 3 different modules as Deimos and Stroud are almost identical, and you are even restricted on the number of parts you are allowed to use and the types you use. Even better is if you place objects in the ship or on weapon racks and mannequins, soon as your change one thing on the exterior it all just goes to the cargo hold or if you are unlucky like me it bugs out and your items are lost. This leads to your ship interior looking the exact same as every other ship but with a different layout. You can fill your ship with all the sandwiches you want but then you can not upgrade it at all. The actual ship builder itself is clunky and unintuitive and lacks any real information regarding your ship or the parts themselves. Then you have the perfect class 4 beast and you get to have 1-2 minute dogfights in a tiny skybox and that is all the use you will get out of the ship as we are playing fast travel menu simulator.There are many other issues but in summary, this is not a good Bethesda game, not a good RPG, not a good space exploration game, sadly it is just an average to slightly above average looter shooter depending on what you are comparing it to. After playing this all excitement for the Elderscrolls 6 has been drained from me and even though it will probably not happen I hope Bethesda can learn from this mistake and not only deliver a more focused experience, but try some innovation for once. You can no longer ride on the back of Morrowind and hope the modders sort the game out for you.',''),(2547,'This is easily GOTY in 2003',''),(2548,'This is very satisfying action rogue like,  It feels like a great mix of Dead cells and hallow knight.

Every hit you take feels entirely like your own fault.But in the natural disasters department?Every enemy is unpredictable, every enemy is hard to avoid, every enemy is a nightmare.The thanager and the boss are the monarchs of \"how in the hell was i MEANT to avoid that?\"Half the attacks punish you FOR dodging by placing a new attack right at your landing zone.Extremely different attacks have very similar telegraphs.Half the hits you take feel like the game put you in an unavoidable situation, or is punishing you for being 1 frame off.This is in STARK contrast to the actual final area of the game, the Time department.This area, while hard, is FAIR.Every attack is well telegraphed, the bosses are dodgeable, and every hit you take FEELS LIKE YOUR FAULT.Another thing this game struggles with is replayability, which is weird to say given it\'s rogue-like nature.Runs don\'t feel different enough to eachother.Most of the difference lies in what weapons you get.The enemies get boring after a while.The pre-built-but-randomly-arranged rooms get samey after your 50th run.And even the weapons start to lose their flair once you realize only about half of them are worth using in any capacity.What makes it worse is that this game is, at it\'s core, a series of boss fights.The actual departments themselves serve more to waste the player\'s time.The enemies are usually not too threatening. With the exception of the unbalanced bozos in the natural disasters department, every enemy is relatively easy to deal with.Even a mediocre build can sweep through most areas with ease.Sure, If you get a mix of tougher enemies, you can take a few hits, but overall it\'s not difficult at all.And then you get to the thanagers and sorrows.And then the game proceeds to completely change it\'s approach and slaughters you.You can take 9+ hits from a normal enemy, only for a boss/miniboss to kill you in 3.And remember, the bosses take a while to kill, so you\'re likely to make a mistake somewhere.The game is a series of boss fights with semi-pointless filler between them.You spend your time between bosses going through floors, easily clearing them, and getting upgrades.The bosses are real challenges that can kill you VERY VERY VERY easily, while everything else is trivial, barely hurts, and is just plain boring.The gameplay would essentially amount to the same thing if it was LITERALLY just a series of boss fights that just let you pick a few random upgrades before each one. That\'s what the game already feels like it is....This game is an \"art first, gameplay second\" type of game.The visuals, the audio, the lore, it\'s all stunning.It\'s not without flaws, that\'s for sure, but almost all of those flaws are easily understandable and excusable.The team behind this game came together to create a work of art.I love the story being told. I love the environments.I love the music.I love the characters.It\'s a damn shame that all the beauty is bound together with mediocre, tedious, and sometimes unfair gameplay.',''),(2561,'a',''),(2562,'A great game.

The game itself has a lot of potential, and my experience first time playing was incredible, just like with games like Slay the Spire or Balatro, but after a certain point feels like it\'s desperately missing content and balance (and not in the way a lot of other negative reviews say: it\'s not too punishing, losing your run to one tiny mistake is what makes clutching out a win with 1 hp left on your champion so satisfying), which makes picking the same cards which are handed to you almost every run always better than trying out different ones - some cards don\'t work well with all tribes, some cards lead to builds that almost cannot beat some certain enemies and some of them are just plain worse than other ones. There\'re many detailed community made balance ideas from players with a lot of experience in the game with really great suggestions, but it feels like they are mostly ignored by the developer, instead favoring short term balance patches that make the game easier to be more accessible to new players, but takes away some of what makes Wildfrost Wildfrost.

It has good presentation, refreshing gameplay formula, and rewards thoughtful play.One of the reasons I felt like writing a review is the sheer amount of negative reviews I disagree with. The amount of \"too hard/too RNG\" misinfo is off the charts! It\'s a very fair game. RNG-heavy? There\'s almost no combat RNG at all, almost everything is telegraphed and can be accounted for. The rewards you get are random, yes, but you can always make a build that\'ll be able to beat the game. If you are genuinely trying to adapt to whatever you get, not just force a build you don\'t have pieces for, you\'ll never feel screwed by the RNG.The game is punishing in a sense that losing your leader means losing the game—but you are never put into such a situation if you pay attention! Wildfrost could be seen as a difficult game as base difficulty is higher than in, say, Slay the Spire. But once you have a grasp on game\'s mechanics, you can have endless win streaks. I\'ve never felt bad after losing a run because it\'s very clear that you, the player, had done something wrong. And if you do everything right, it feels very rewarding to breeze through the fights. You need to plan ahead and pay attention to multiple timers, but it\'s not as scary as it might appear.If there was something to criticize Wildfrost for, it\'s the potential playtime. Compared to games like Slay the Spire, replayability is on the lower side. There\'s no officially supported modding and content-wise game might get stale.

I literally had to keep reminding myself to exit out while I was done a run or else I would have played until I couldn\'t stay awake any longer.',''),(2634,'This is a very weird do not recommend because over 11 hours in I have been enjoying the game a lot. It has some really cool mechanics with the charms (card augments), unit placements with the rows and front to back attack order, the various status ailments (both positive and negative), and the relatively unique tribes. It\'s also pretty well balanced so far, I win maybe 20-30% of my runs, with both RNG and my own mistakes coming into play there. It feels satisfying in both regards.All of that being said, it feels like another 10 hours and I\'m done with the game. If your goal is to just grind higher and higher difficulties (with various debuffs to a run that you can toggle on and off, although I see no benefit for pushing it other than maybe a couple hidden unlocks), then that\'s fine and you might love this game. But for me personally, one of my favorite part of rogue lites is unlocking new stuff and evolving my game play around that. Other than some of the charm unlocking through challenges, it seems like about 20 hours will cap out the new content, maybe more if you aren\'t familiar with this kind of genre. That\'s just not enough replay value for me.It\'s a very well made game mechanics wise and art wise, I am enjoying it a lot, but I\'m going to burn out quick in the next couple days. For a $20 game that\'s not terrible, but there\'s better bang for your buck out there in that regard. I really hope they focus on adding new content, and if they do--and the game evolves--I will change my my review. But for now my vote is to just wait for now unless you are either a casual player that might spend more time on this, or are a veteran just looking for something new within the genre.',''),(2635,'The game is very difficult.

I have just a bit of experience with deck builders and I was able to beat the highest difficult of the game in just a few hours. With updates it got even more balanced, with more options to play the run and also more options to make it more challenging)',''),(2637,'Very fun game. People complain about the difficulty were somewhat valid, but balance has improved.',''),(2638,'Relaxing and very detailed underwater city building game.',''),(2639,'I\'m going to give it a thumbs up, but only because I don\'t think it deserves a thumbs down. It wasn\'t awful, but it wasn\'t anything special either.I have mixed feelings about this game. I love the underwater theme, and I like colony builders, but Aquatico is simply just ONE MORE generic colony builder sim, that really doesn\'t stand out in any meaningful way. At least it didn\'t for me.The game loop wasn\'t satisfying enough to keep my interest. You just place a bunch of buildings and connect them... and don\'t forget to put some of these buildings in close proximity to other specific buildings, or you\'ll lose out on bonus perks. For some people that might be enjoyable, but I found it to be annoying.Another thing that specifically annoyed me was that when placing buildings, it also eliminated the resources on the sea-bed floor. (sponge plants for example) Sponge is an important resource, and I get that if you plunk down a foundation and put a building on top of plants they aren\'t going to survive, BUT proximity to resources is important in this game. It take drones significantly longer times to go further and further away from the center of the colony to collect resources, which becomes less and less fun the bigger your colony grows.Buildings could just as easily have been implemented as above sea-bed structures, built on stilts/legs/pillars (think sub-nautica) which would then preserve the sea-bed resources, but that\'s not how it works in Aquatico. Too bad, so sad, but oh well.My recommendation is to buy it if you\'re a die hard colony builder and want to try something new, but otherwise, wait for it to go on sale if the game sounds interesting to you. Hopefully you\'ll enjoy it more than I did.Ciao!',''),(2640,'Good ideas, joyless execution.Its looks fine, i love the idea but it just soooo boring.',''),(2641,'Fun game.

Spider-Man Remastered is truly a masterpiece.RUNS PHENOMENALLY ON STEAM DECK AT 30+ FPS(There was an issue late in the second act where dialogue audio wouldn\'t play properly, but it didn\'t last more than a few minutes- easy to overlook and probably just a quirk of the Deck)I purchased this game at a 33% discount, and I feel like I had a 5-Star meal, alongside a delicious after-course.I\'ve very stubborn when it comes to my decisions about which games to play, let-alone continue playing after the initial boot. I know next to nothing about Marvel but this game had me absolutely hooked, on the edge of my seat to see what comes next. The emotional highs, lows, the writing, the interactions- the world, it\'s all so real and convincing. This game made me feel like a real superhero.It\'s so refreshing for me to play a game that truly feels like it cut no corners. There\'s no missing context. No bossfights that end before they start. No glaring technical issues. No loose ends. The world is massive and yet I cannot recall encountering a single glitch- it\'s unbelievable how much love, care and time went in to polishing this game.It took me 14 hours to reach the credits, and I am beyond satisfied with what I spent / what I received in return. I haven\'t even touched the DLCs yet.If you\'re a Marvel fan, this is a must-play.If you\'re not a Marvel fan, but you like great movement, combat, and exciting story full of many twists and turns, then I urge you to try Spider-Man Remastered',''),(2644,'Really enjoyed this game.

The achievements were also easy to get for the most part although there were some that were tied to the challenges around the city that were a bit frustrating for me to do.

Without a doubt, I would give a full score for the innovative controls. In terms of combat, it may seem a bit monotonous at the beginning, but as the game progresses, more fighting skills are developed.

About an hour ago I had completed the New Game Plus and earned all of the achievements the game has to offer. It offers a unique and somewhat a slightly different feel while keeping many of the fun aspects from its previous entry.Personally, I like Miles as a character, in short he is just cool and stylish. The way he utilizes his web swinging skills is also noticeably different from Peter\'s but in a good way. It is exactly how I imagine myself how fun would it be if I were a Spider-Man. There are lots of air-tricks that you can perform in addition to the new fluid looking animations. I\'d say the combat is an upgrade too, there are Miles\' new \"Venom Power\" and \"Camouflage\" abilities which can be used depending on the situation. For stealth tactic I used the \"Camouflage\" ability quite often before engaging into multiple enemies. Eventually, the best part of the combat for me is having a totally new finishing moves, completely different from Peter\'s.However there are 2 things I dislike in this game. First, I don\'t find the story to be that exciting in general. The villain itself is kind of lame in my opinion. I won\'t be focusing too much on the story though, as it is a journey that you are supposed to experience by yourself.  Finally, the moment you knew it was over, you\'d probably be unsure whether you are satisfied with your purchase or not. Why? The game is just way too short. Some people believe that it feels more like a DLC rather than being an actual full game. Final thoughts? Well, definitely buy it on sale.',''),(2668,'If you’ve not played Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales before, the PC version is an easy recommendation on Steam Deck. Miles Morales is a tighter and more focused take on the formula than the original game with better combat and a brilliant use of licensed music.

It is yet another ‘perfect on Steam Deck’ experience from Sony.',''),(2669,'Great game but I can\'t believe someone decided that a 6 hour campaign is worth $75 AUD.I bought it at half price and I still feel ripped off.',''),(2670,'The way he leaps off of rooftops and flips backwards to face the camera before falling into a headfirst dive is just full of the exaggerated swagger of a black teen.',''),(2671,'I cant recommend this game. First it has crashed so many times on me. My comp is solid, drivers are updated, I dont have this issue with any other game, but for some reason it just hard crashes often. Second the story sucks. God the main antagonist is absolute garbage. A person who is playing the victim, is way overpowered for being a person, and is trying to play the hero at the same time. Its difficult to talk about without spoiling, but the character is constantly blaming our lead Miles and acting like its all his fault while 100% being as much to blame if not more. You lied to me... but does the same thing. I am a hero, but blows up buildings. A literal walking contradiction, boring re-skinned character. I never knew the tinkerer, but lets just say they re-imagined that character. The story is lame. Third where the first game was way bloated with too many sides and other stuff, this is very sparse. And still feels too long. I am at a point where I am 100% hate playing. I paid $30 and I was trying to hold off until it dropped to $20-25, I should have just held off. I stopped having fun within the first couple of hours, but hoped i would turn it around. But even trying to stick to only main missions still feels too long. Fast travel animation is boring. Swinging is not as clean as the first one and where I had some fun the first time around, by the end of the main story of the first game I was already fast traveling most of the time. The fighting mechanics feel tight at first, but dear god nothing is more infuriating then being punched from off screen or shot while in an animation killing your streak. Also like batman, like the first game its punch punch dodge. You can do more, but no point. Additionally gadgets dont recharge fast enough. While sneaking around it would be cool to use the remote mine, but most of the time I have none left. Maybe I dont understand the mechanic that allows me to gain more, but its driving me nuts. The game is stripped down. 4 gadgets as far as I can tell. Suits are kind of lame looking and you have to choose between cool looking skin or useful suit. A ton of stuff to do, but nothing important or fun, this is very similar to the first game. I will say having the camouflage and the indicator that someone is safe to attack makes stealth doable, but its take 10 minutes doing stealth with a high probability that you will get caught and end up fighting or take 5 minutes to fight. Just depends. Typically I bleed the herd and finish with a fight. But in the end most missions are punch punch block/dodge. I found the last third of the first game to feel very repetitive, I am finding this just as repetitive and boring. In all reality the first game didnt need the DLC. It was a complete game and was already a bit bloated. The DLC was boring and every bearing. This game should have been the dlc and should have starting cost of $30. Honestly playing this made me realize i probably should just skip 2. So luckily I am saving quite a bit of money even though I feel I wasted $30.Overall I am finding the mechanics boring. The story absolute garbage. The gameplay ok. And the stability is bad. I did love the first game... until I didnt. I found myself rushing the last half and hating playing the DLC. I thought my frustration was the DLC, but I am realizing the game itself is kind of boring. I dont know if you could do a lot more with this, but you could kill a lot of it and it would be a lot better. I am trying oh so hard to finish, but if it keeps crashing and the story keeps being absolute garbage. No reason.',''),(2672,'poop',''),(2673,'Game keeps crashing while loading.

During each dive you are tasked to find a few things or you encounter side quests while following the main quest that leads the player deeper and deeper into the ocean of the Blue Hole.Personal NoteThe gameplay loop of diving during the day and selling sushi by night is pretty simple, but soon after your first handful of dives the gameplay loop changes a bit – sure, you still need to dive and catch fish to ensure that your sushi restaurant runs well, but you will encounter bosses and challenges ahead that makes the game a bit harder.The progression system in the game feels natural since you unlock more gadgets and recipes by following the main story and by simply playing the game, without feeling the need to grind to get certain gadgets or upgrades.I personally wasn’t sure if I would enjoy playing the game at first and saw a Streamer play it and I bought it soon after. Dave the Diver has something unique to it: The cutscenes are amazing, the references to other things are good, the gameplay loop is simple but rewarding and most importantly: It’s a fun game and certainly one of the more surprising releases of 2023 (if you consider that it was available in early access at the end of 2022).RatingPros Nice story and good humor Good graphics and aesthetics   Chill soundtrack Unique-ish concept Usually well-made boss fightsCons Keyboard controls can be a bit iffy Some bosses can be a bit thoughConclusion Dave the Diver is a game that just keeps on giving, which is rare in 2023.

Well, now I can certainly say I understand everything now. The strong core gameplay loop accompanied with the sheer amount of features and events easily make the game charming and fun. Things don\'t stop there. The story and the characters are oozing with personality. The humorous cut-scenes, various events to spice up the restaurant-managing experience, and a ton of mini games sprinkled over each quests and regions, all packaged up together in this lovely pixelated \"indie\" darling. It is no wonder that Dave The Diver receives such an overwhelmingly positive review. I would go even further and say that it is one of the best in the work-sim/two-in-one genre. It would be really hard to topple this giant. I cannot recommend Dave The Diver enough.Things I Like About Dave The Diver:1. Looting Before FishingLike every other working-simulators, you always need to start from scratch and gather as much resources as possible. However, Dave The Diver does things a little differently. Scattering around the ocean floor are various boxes. Inside each boxes contain equipments that are slightly stronger than your basic one(they will break when you leave the water), so it is always better to loot the boxes first before you fish. This small design not only incentivizes players to explore ocean more thoroughly, it also offers a great benefit to them. Because of these limited but better equipments, players are in no urgency to dump all the coins into upgrading their gears. Thus, they can have some leeway how to spend their money, either hiring and training better staff or expanding the farms.2. The Sheer Amount Of ContentWow, where do I even begin? Dave The Diver has so much things to do: fishing(obviously), scavenging, taking photos(though not freely), exploring, fighting giant creatures, chasing things, being chased by other things, managing a restaurant, hiring staves for higher quality, serving drinks and sushi, decorating, assisting chef contests, helping the VIP quests, feeding cat, stealthily following said cat, fish-farming, farming(actually), keeping chickens, keeping a virtual pet, playing music game, browsing through the game\'s equivalent of IG, helping the local marine magazine, playing in an underwater casino, seahorse-racing, riding a pink beluga, resisting the urge to shove the grenade launcher up a certain sea person\'s rear, stealthily avoiding zombie sea people, infiltrating a secret base, sling shooting a turtle, playing It Takes Two on your own, fighting a fanatic multiple times, shooting missiles at a giant ancient sea creature, arcade-shooting, the list goes on and on.3. Other Compliments→Lovely pixelated art style.→Very catchy tunes.→Some scenes in the game are magnificent.→The icon of each dish looks tasty.→Weapons have various upgrade path.→Each employee has a unique Cooksta post.Things I Dislike About Dave The Diver:1. Not Enough Randomized LayoutThe first time I saw them in-game dialogue describing Blue Hole as ever-changing, I was expecting the layout would be randomized. I was disappointed to find out that the scale of randomization is way too small. In my play through it is always the same three terrains(a ravine, a plain, and a corral cliff) for the first area. There\'s actually a fourth one, kelp forest, but for some reason it never spawn over two times for me in an in-game month. The situation does not improve since the second and the third region barely randomized at all. I think I know the reason behind this. In order to keep the important areas easy to reach, the layout cannot be randomized too drastically or else the players would have a hard time finding the right place before emptying the oxygen tank.

Somewhere between all the discourse that floods the gaming industry (I could go on and on here): unfulfilled promises from AAA publishers/studios, incomplete games that are listed full price, nearly all multiplayer based games switching to a \"battle-pass\" or other form of paid live service; or outrightly lying to consumers, my faith for gaming has rotten into cynicism and resentment. This game, however, made me forget all of that negativity and laziness (gift-wrapped-inside-of-greed.) It\'s really entirely unique in what it sets out to accomplish. I\'ve played many other ocean-esque style games, or store/tavern/farm type simulators that have partial RPG undertones. This game, takes the funnest parts of those genres and collaborates them into something really, different and new and I seriously cannot get enough of it. It does this consistently and seems to always deliver something new each time you complete a day-cycle in-game, and at some points almost too much where I felt only slightly overwhelmed (not in a bad way.) Any time that a thought, like \"this is great but if they added this...\" crossed my mind, it delivered it (so far I\'ve counted around five or six times.) The story had depth and is interesting and is also consistently building on-itself throughout your play-thru. What is this, feelings? In a game? Is this hope I smell?All of the content that it offers as you progress comes at the perfect moment and makes you feel like your accomplishing something. There are some redundancies, like with any other game; however, I never found myself bored doing the more minuscule or repetitious tasks/chores: like collecting the same kind of fish a bunch of times, or finding weapons in sunken chests 3(?) times so that you can unlock it to construct, or going back to some really deep depth to catch another species you missed. My favorite of these simply involves feeding a cat (its worth it, trust me.)I really could just go on and on, but I digress. Just play it. Give it a shot and I\'m sure you will be pleasantly surprised and find yourself quickly sucked into the world and all that it has to offer, and it\'s a lot. It gives you so much for the price its listed at and its on sale, so... yeah. Also, I would love to talk about all the mechanics and what you can do in the game, but I feel they\'re wrapped around too many spoilers, and part of the fun is just going in blind and feeling that spark that I was talking about before. I can honestly say I\'m smitten by this game and if I had to pick a favorite of 2023, this would be it... and I\'ve played just about every AAA title that\'s come out thus far. None of those have kept me as engaged.Thank you Mintrocket, I look forward to finishing this and playing the DLC. Thanks for restoring a portion of my hope in that: some people in this industry still care about play-ability, consistency and story. This has felt quite complete so far constantly keeps giving and I really look forward to completing it, but will likely be sad when I do.',''),(2706,'How addictive is this game?Well I just spent more than 200 hrs in 1 Month for this game',''),(2707,'Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle.This is of course my personal views and feelings on this game, so take my review into prespective with other both positive and negative review to get a better picture of what you might get from this game.Throws more and more systems and tasks at you rather than making fewer things have more depth.The company that made this is a shell company of Nexon and I can definitely feel that influence. There\'s a lot of attempted charm and personality but it fall feels incredibly calculated. The writing (almost nonsensical), the characters (cooky and random), the locations that at times don\'t even make sense within the game universe\'s own logic. There\'s also certain mobile game influences that don\'t make sense, like operator codes to unlock appearances with. There\'s just so much stuff thrown into this game that makes me feel like they had idea after idea and just implemented it until they had their next idea. It\'s unfocused and busy.Hell, I can\'t help but shake the feeling AI had something to do with this game. This game that has been in development for some 4 years, by a company that has only existed for about 1½.I\'m naturally suspicious so maybe I\'m being overly paranoid.Now that the game has thrown yet another new system at me with tasks I have to complete I feel like I probably don\'t care to finish this game anymore. It all feels like hollow padding of a homonculus of a game that doesn\'t quite know what it is.But hey, it\'s cheap.

The game filled me with nostalgia and not to mention the gorgeous pixel art style and stunning animations which I almost never skip. The story itself is quite nice and captivating. The game is meant for casuals who sometimes want little challenge, but not a souls-like challenge, so that it doesn\'t get boring.The addition of a running a sushi bar is absolutely adorable due to its simplicity. The game play itself can be seen as repetitive for some because its meant for casuals but that\'s the charm of it. If you\'re feeling a bit spicy and aggressive get the  flame  shotgun  (yes it burns) , if you\'re feeling cautious you can get the  sniper . There are multiple ways to play a dive run!

A lot of the gameplay was: make numbers go up, collect X of Y object, go to a farm multiple times a day to manually remove weeds, and so on.The game also heavily featured \"quick-time event\" type interactions. It showed me a prompt on screen to press a button, and then I pressed that button, again and again, and that\'s as deep as it got for much of the gameplay. This was especially true in the mini-games, which Dan the Diver had in over-abundance. So many shallow, one-off mini-games, which didn’t require any decision-making, and didn’t ask me to develop any reusable skills. It just said \"press this button\", and then I pressed it.I enjoyed the boss fights the most, which were the rare place where the game didn’t just tell me what to do, but instead let me figure it out for myself. I also enjoyed setting the menu at the sushi restaurant each night, trying to balance food price with popularity and maximize sales for the day.I did finish the game though, and I did have some fun.

I didn\'t even know the character\'s names. This was my very first playthrough. I think it\'s safe to assume the vast majority of those who will read this have already played the original or are at least vaguely aware of it.So here\'s what you want to know:It\'s a visual upgrade from the 2013 original, and it has the Left Behind DLC included. Performance wise, it ran great, or better than I saw being reported. Tech:On a mix of Ultra and High settings, it ran around 60-80FPS at 1440p on the following specifications:Ryzen 5 5600XRTX307032BG DDR4 2x16 3600MHzThere were occasional hiccups where the game would drop into the 50 FPS range and more often, the game would flash textures in and out of existence. None of them were game breaking, however.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3098178355For everyone else:I don\'t think this game is terribly unique. Not even in the time that it originally came out. If you combine Resident Evil 4, TellTale\'s the Walking Dead — both of which technically predate this game, 2005 and 2012 respectively. I think you can ostensibly predict what this game entails.That said, it\'s still an extremely well told story and traditional triple A video game. Which is to say, it\'s pretty good — again, just not that unique. More specifically, the game is played from an over-the-shoulder camera, primarily focusing on stealth and resource management. The game actually does a very good job at making switching weapons rather cumbersome until further into the game and you upgrade your pack. Which can be be done through finding weapon parts and using them at workbenches, finding manuals (not unlike Fallout, they\'ll increase explosive\'s radius or increase the number of uses of a shiv before it breaks, for example.) There\'s also the more human upgrades like healing or crafting speed which can be done by spending supplements. Found in either pill bottles or by harvesting the plants the supplements are derived from. Melee works very similarly to State of Decay 2, where it has a condition and wears down from use.You\'re able to “listen” to your environment, either for zombies or humans. This information is conveyed visually as bright spots as the mode greys the world out.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3098185525The GistIf you\'ve already played this, I can\'t say I really see a reason to play this version specifically.

It\'s playable and probably better than before, but the game still has sudden frame drops, stuttering, occasional glitches and maybe won\'t even be updated in the future. Having played the original remastered version, I can say that at least this remake displays many improvements such as better textures, environments, reflections, lighting, character models and animations.I hope Sony won\'t let Iron Galaxy Studios touch any other Playstation game.

I had to build the shaders 3 times, and took a good 3 hours in total for them to all be compiled. 5 hours of gameplay that was constantly met with changing graphical settings, messing with unofficial FSR3+FG mods that also hit a good amount of lows (due to again, the horrible optimization), making the game unplayable.Interestingly, I\'m using hardware that meets the recommended specs on a performance scale (RTX 3060 TI + Ryzen 5 3600). Despite the GPU surpassing the recommended specs, I\'m surprised that the game, which supposedly matches my system requirements, struggles to run.

However if I\'ve ever played a game that deserves a neutral review its this one in its current state, there\'s a lot to like, but just too much wrong with it to be called a \"good\" game currently.Positively the game is clearly inspired by the likes of Surviving Mars, Voxel Tycoon, Infraspace. Atmospherically feels very similar to Banished too, so if anyone loves these titles then this should catch your attention. The game is clearly going for a more laid back approach than a lot of other base builders, a lot of the logistics is handled by drones which largely take care of things themselves, so quite a refreshing change to not have to micromanage every exchange of resources going on. I\'m actually gonna say that the complete absence of a power system is a welcome change and makes for a more relaxed experience (i get that a lot of games go for a bit of realism but it gets frustrating needing to build a shed load of wind turbines every time i want to expand my base)Negatively, the game is very much a hand holding experience in the early stages making you quite limited to what you can do. You need to progress through stages of objectives to unlock very basic features, such as roads, which I feel like should be baseline. This i feel takes a lot of the freedom out of the game in early stages, totally love a \"research tree\" style of unlocking in these games that you can do at your own pace, but this game very much teaches you to crawl when you can already walk, and a lot of the things you unlock end up being key parts of your infrastructure later on where you then need to rebuild areas of your base you\'d done previously.The \"city building\" aspect of the game just feels very empty, player has very little control over how the city grows or looks, and simply happens in an automated way as you feed resources into requested areas, definitely doesn\'t have the \"human\" aspects that surviving mars or similar titles have, the citizens are just another number rather than being something that fulfils a purpose. The growth of the city by feeding in an ever growing number of resource demand is one of the core gameplay mechanics, but currently feels like there isnt much satisfaction watching your city grow.Will say overall im enjoying my experience and will continue playing the game, i just really hope the creators continue to improve QOL upgrades to the game.',''),(2743,'There is still a lot of potential.I like it.',''),(2744,'---{ Graphics }---☐ You forget the Real World☑ Beautiful☑ Good☐ Decent☐ Bad☐ Don‘t look too long at it☐ My Eye\'s!!!---{ Game play }---☑ Very good☐ Good☐ It\'s just game play☐ Meh.......☐ Watch paint dry instead☐ Just don\'t---{ Audio }---☐ Amazing!☑ Very good☐ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ I\'m now deaf---{ Audience }---☐ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☐ Grandma---{ PC Requirements }---☑ Check if you can run the isle☐ Potato☑ Decent☑ Fast☐ Rich bio☐ Greatest PC Ever---{ Difficulty }---☐ Just press \'W\'☑ Easy☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master☑ Significant brain usage☐ Difficult☐ Dark Souls---{ Grind }---☐ Nothing to grind☐ Only if u care about leader boards/ranks☐ Isn\'t necessary to progress☑ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ You\'ll need a second live for grinding---{ Story }---☐ No Story☐ Some lore☐ Average☐ Good☑  Lovely☐ It\'ll replace your life---{ Game Time }---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☑ Average☐ Long☐ To infinity and beyond---{ Price }---☐ It\'s free!☑ Worth the price☑ If it\'s on sale☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your money---{ Bugs! }---☐ Never heard of☑ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ Problematic☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs/glitches---{ 0 / 10 }---☐ 1☐ 2☐ 3☐ 4☐ 5☐ 6☐ 7☐ 8☑ 9☐ 10---------------------------------------',''),(2745,'Good source of fanservice for those that can see the obvious parallels drawn with the original Fate/Stay Night VN, multiple details and visuals are very obviously there as callbacks.

I was originally attracted to it because its a phas clone but with much better visuals. And to be fair it does have very nice looking maps. There is a lot of detail and creepy atmosphere in its maps. The safehouses are pretty cool too, and you can spend money unlocking permanent cosmetics such as different safehouses and furniture for them. Which is a cool idea, but the problem it doesn\'t go far enough, leaving the safehouses still looking bare and bland. Character customisation is a nice touch too with minimal customisation. But basically, those are the good things. Everything else is bad. The game is essentially a Phasmophobia clone, with less maps, less equipment, no hiding places and virtually no chance to survive the hunts until you learn how and where you can loop the ghost. There is no mechanic to carry more gear such as in Forewarned, you\'re stuck carrying 3 gear only, and that means 2 if you want a flashlight. All optional objectives are locked until you decide which ghost it is. While putting Exorcism in the game is pretty cool at first, it ends up being too easy or too confusing wtf you\'re supposed to do. Levelling up in the game unlocks some maps and items, but after a certain point does nothing at all and is completely pointless. In addition, the game still plays like an early access game, filled with bugs and crashes and instability issues. Often the EMF reading occurs in the wrong room, bleeding through into the floor above or below, and sometimes even sounds can be heard a fair distance away from the \'ghost room.\' Sure banging doors or moving furniture could be heard in different rooms but for example, in the hospital, you shouldn\'t be able to hear rustling sheets or squeaking trolleys in a distant corridor on a whole different level. Another criticism is the \"Susie storyline.\" One of the secrets of the game is a badly written, badly told story about a mad person called Susie, and you have to go back and forth between the most expensive safehouse and the asylum map reading exhaustive notes. Only the host player can read the notes so in multiplayer its frustrating not being able to do anything and standing around whilst player 1 reads the notes out because no one else can even see them. The climax comes with a choice, but again only the host player can make it or even see the book. There is an achievement for completing the story, but you guessed right, you don\'t get it unless you\'re the host player. An utterly disappointing and frustrating waste of time. The devs don\'t listen to the community and released out of early access without warning. It should be noted their previous 2 games were abandoned and although they say this game will be updated, I wouldn\'t get your hopes up. Even looking at the game\'s trello board reveals nothing at all, there is no evidence on what the devs are working on and no promises for future content.

It brought back the feeling of playing Phasmophobia for the first time. The levels are quite detailed and the interactions and special events in each level are more intense and captivating. There\'s more of a narrative wrapped around what you\'re doing compared to other ghost hunting games, which is fun to unpick when you\'re playing with friends in multiplayer.The initial level proved a bit of a learning curve and you have to replay it a fair few times before progressing. There are some rough edges too. The player models look generic and the ingame customisation store is split into two by gender; at first I thought it wasn\'t letting me select the hoodie I bought for my character, but turns out I bought the female hoodie, with no obvious way to sell it (and for some reason female was set to default purchase even though the default character is male, which is a massive troll.) Other issues include stuttering before events happen (which can ruin immersion) and my game crashes whenever the lobby closes. There\'s potential to fix these things and the foundations of what this game is are pretty solid. For those of us looking for a fun multiplayer horror experience, this ticks most boxes.

This game had so much potential, it is fun, and inventive with great designs for practically everything.

It hurts that I can\'t recommend this game because it is really fun and has so much potential it will never reach because Electronic Arts simply doesn\'t care about it like most of their games, and I will be honest this game is never getting another update. I can tell KOEI TECMO who have experience in the monster hunting genre with other solid games like Toukiden knew what they were doing here and really wanted to make something good, I wish they would have been given the chance. The game is solid but its launch was riddled with performance issues and like any EA game that was enough to give it the axe instead of just giving it that little bit of time, and resources it needed to be a great experience and maybe even a true Monster Hunter franchise competitor. Its a shame to see games like this that could really do well be ruined on the whims of corporate suits but sadly that is the reality of a lot of game development, don\'t buy this game now unless its really cheap and go in expecting mediocre quality, this game is such a lost opportunity and that\'s a shame, its also a shame I have to lament the money I spent on it, but i\'m sure EA is happy about that.',''),(2788,'I played for about 40 or so hours on Game Pass to \"try it out\" and, well, I put about 40 hours into it there and got it on sale here. I wasn\'t expecting my save file to transfer over and that was a very nice bonus surprise. I like the game and hope the surge of Game Pass players and sales from people like me who liked it enough to go buy it encourage them to come back and keep adding more content. Or make a sequel.I\'ve had a few performance issues here and there, but nothing more noticeable than a slight dip in framerate in certain spots or when grouping up with other players and a ton of effects go off at once, but it\'s not even a consistent enough problem to impact my suggestion to check it out-if only on sale or on Game Pass. It has crossplay, so don\'t let the Steam numbers fool you into thinking no one\'s playing it. It also launches thru EA\'s stupid launcher, so I\'m assuming that\'s not only how my file crossed over, but how the matchmaking is supported. It\'s very unfortunate EA is the publisher of this game because it is a fantastic foundation to be a true competitor in the Monster Hunter game genre.For starters, the movement and combat system is better than in either of the Monster Hunter games I\'ve played so far. Those games felt pretty wonky/janky/clunky in terms of how you fight and move around to chase down the monsters. In Wild Hearts, however, the movement system is a lot faster and the combat feels more fluid and fun to play with more of the weapons. I\'ve mainly used the bladed wagasa (umbrella), but I enjoyed the katana they start you off with and the bow and hand cannon, as well as the claw/blade, and the shapeshifting staff weapon that turns into a giant shuriken, twin tonfas, or a bladed polearm with different attack sets for each transformation. I haven\'t tried the giant hammer or sword yet because I\'ve been having so much fun with the umbrella\'s combat.Outside the weapons, you also have access to an increasing number of what the game calls karakuri. Contraptions used to move around the maps or fight the monsters in the game. As you keep playing, you might get what the game refers to as bursts of inspiration while fighting specific monsters and unlock fusion karakuri. Basically, you can quickly place a combination of basic contraptions and they\'ll fuse together into a new one that does something to help you out during the fight. It could be providing you and your allies a healing mist in an area, a giant bomb to damage and stun the monster, a fireworks explosion to bring down a flying one, a big barricade to stop a charging attack, and so on. There\'s a wide range of things you can try to quickly make or place during a fight to help. The basic karakuri can be things like springboards to launch yourself at or out of the the way of monsters, a flame to coat your weapons in for a bit to potentially set the monster on fire, blocks to climb up high and do a drop/jump attack on it, or even a celestial thread to connect yourself to a point on the ground and quickly move yourself around. All those and more can potentially be combined to make new things on the fly that will help take down the monsters faster and it all makes hunting them more fun and engaging.Then there\'s the weapon crafting and upgrade system. As you\'re running around the maps, there are plenty of small monsters to kill and materials to collect to help make weapons/armor in addition to the parts you get from hunting the big monsters. Each weapon type has a big upgrade tree you can look at and enhance/alter it\'s damage type and appearance as you work down it. If you choose to revert to a previous version to try a different route, you usually get the items back used to upgrade it. I think it\'s done to encourage experimentation and changing your weapons for specific monster weaknesses. I like that it also lets you change the inherited traits from previous versions you upgraded it from. Like if you\'re working down a path that adds a specific trait you want, you can keep it for future upgrades and sort of further customize your weapons as you upgrade them. In addition, the armor sets often have what\'s known as a Human or Kemono path you can use to modify and upgrade them. Depending on the path you choose, you not only get a different cosmetic look to the armor, but you can potentially unlock different abilities for it if you\'re far enough down the path. For example, I went full Kemono and have a trait that will let me ignore death once when I take fatal damage. It\'s great for giving me an extra chance to try and heal and finish killing the monster.In all, I think I fought about a dozen different big monsters not including different versions of the same one but I also haven\'t finished hunting the main monster from Chapter 3. I don\'t want to spoil anything, but I think not long after I got to Chapter 3, it felt like going from Low to High Rank in Monster Hunter World if that makes sense to anyone. Like the world shifted and a bunch of more powerful versions of monsters appeared and some new ones showed up and I\'m able to go to the next tier of weapons and armor. I tried to fight the big monster for the chapter ASAP and it wrecked me. I now am trying to upgrade my gear before trying to tackle it a second time with the realization that for the most part, I\'ve been having more fun playing this than I did during most of my time with Monster Hunter games. I wanted to like them, but I think I like this more.After each hunt of a big monster, you get something called kemono orbs (you can also get them from breaking and chopping off parts of kemono/monsters) and you can use those to upgrade and unlock new karakuri. The basic and fusion karakuri used for combat aren\'t the only kind in the game. There are also a kind called dragon karakuri and they are permanent structures you place in your maps/world. They can be simple decorations or a means of collecting materials or further processing those materials for use during hunts. Such as a device to collect fish from water sources and then a drying rack to dry out those fish. Fish are one of the kinds of food you can eat raw or refine to provide better stats in exchange for using up more than you get out of it. Like 9 veggies to produce 3 dried veggies with better stats. Eating the food is this games way of temporarily boosting your stats like HP or defense, only they seem to last for a certain amount of real time rather than a specific hunt because I\'ve had it last even after I lost a hunt and tried a different one. Beyond the food, you just have a simple healing item you can increase the amount of which can be carried by finding and collecting things called tsukumo scattered around the maps and upgrading yours at a campfire. A campfire is one of the dragon karakuri you can build around the map. There are also things like ziplines and aerial lifts and a scouting tower to help locate monsters for hunting-and all karakuri which can be upgraded from the kemono orbs you get for hunting monsters.With all that combined and the lack of needing to stop and sharpen your weapon to keep fighting without your attacks bouncing off the monsters, it\'s a lot more fun and engaging to fight the monsters in this like I said earlier in the review. If you think your machine can handle it, I definitely recommend checking it out. There\'s not only a good amount of content to this game for their first attempt at a Monster Hunter style game, but all the things they did different to put their own spin on the formula make it work better overall-at least in my opinion. It\'s one where I think whether you really enjoyed the Monster Hunter games or tried to get into them and just couldn\'t, you should check this out. (Probably on sale and/or on Game Pass. I like the devs Koei Tecmo, but I really dislike EA and their decision to try and charge $70 for games now.)',''),(2789,'Really fun and enjoyable game. Played a lot more outside of steam.But for next time... let\'s not go with EA',''),(2790,'My review is long overdue, mainly because I was saddened by how this game lost its support. This game had a lot of potential in the monster-hunting category, maybe not enough to make the Monster Hunter series \"sweat\" as new competition but enough to make the players see that the genre can evolve more than what Monster Hunter currently provides.If this game is on a big sale (at least 50% or more, maybe 75% if you can\'t spare too much), this game is worth picking up just to experience the fresh ideas the devs had. Please note that my pointers below are in comparison to Monster Hunter as it\'s arguably the biggest name for the genre Wild Hearts is in.Pros: - The karakuri system as an idea as well as how it was executed is the biggest pro. It is a new inventive way to interact with your environment in order to plan your hunts and mobility to augment your quality of life during gameplay. This was something that I strongly feel was not expected by anyone coming into the monster-hunting genre much less this game. It expanded how you approached each quest rather than simply augmenting some factors of it.Karakuri introduced new ways of base-building such as being able to customize your own camps and move them around, resource farming, ziplines you could place for mobility and so much more. To me, this was something that Monster Hunter should have adopted a long time ago. The freedom to make a map comfy for you in whatever shape or form is amazing.Combat karakuri added a fun and freeing way to approach how you can augment your fight kind of like how wirebugs work in Monster Hunter Rise, but combat karakuri are more tangible in use as they can directly influence combat rather than passively influence your skills. You can build a wall to shield yourself, build a gadget to hover in midair for eagle-eye vision and positioning, or simply create weapons like ballistas for extra damage.- Diverse weapon fighting styles is something that Monster Hunter already has, but Wild Hearts expands on this with its unique weapons that encourage you to dominate not only on the ground, but in aerial combat as well. Because of the karakuri system, weapons have ways to incorporate aerial combos not only for mobility, but to get better angles on hits.The claw blade lets you perform guerilla attacks to a monster, the cannon lets you use an arguably nuclear laser, and the wagasa introduces a new way to enhance people who like parries or counters.Cons: - Linear gear progression (specifically armor). There\'s not many skills to customize and most of your changes are tied to your weapon crafting tree. The armor skills are still neat, but because it pits you into choosing one or two forms of passive skills, there\'s not a lot you can customize. I suppose this is somewhat fair as the available weapons and combat in general are already customizable.- Performance can tank at times. This is an ongoing issue, and even though I rarely ran into this myself, I do admit that because Wild Hearts requires you to be able to watch things happen smoothly, any frame drops may kill you both in-game and your motivation to play. A part of me thinks they definitely could have toned down on the outer ends of the environments and made it easier within the sandbox instead.I haven\'t played in a long while due to responsibilities IRL, but this game is definitely one I look fondly back on. Wholeheartedly recommend this game to those who can afford it, and/or those who wish to see a new way monster-hunting can still evolve as a genre. The pros outweigh the cons, and with enough budget and time, this game could have easily solidified a spot as a monster-hunting game in the genre.',''),(2791,'Unfortunately a waste of money fix the bugs and make smoother and will definitely come back.',''),(2792,'good game but the performance issues make it basically unplayable',''),(2793,'Works well through EA app when I played through my sub (100+ hours and 40/48 achievements).

I\'ve played an older MHFU game as well as MH World just like I\'ve played Toukiden 2 and Wild Hearts.  MH is overrated for my own taste compared to the competitor.  I tried forcing myself to play MHFU multiple times while later the same year I completed Toukiden 2 and even started a 2nd play through because it was that fun (Played them on my Vita).  With Prior hunter experience being set, I tried Wild Hearts and MH World.MH World (from my experience) is for people who want a chill and easy game to play.  There\'s nothing wrong with that.  Wild Hearts is like going from pop to POW with the gameplay personally.  It\'s faster, innovative, and has combos to find with the basic karakuri.  There\'s no discussion for which game is more fleshed out more.  1 game has years of refinement for what it is while the other had less than 1 year with literally \"EA\".  MH World will have more content and such like it should after having years of refinement.  Wild Hearts just simply has better gameplay.  Given they had a publisher that wouldn\'t ♥♥♥♥ with the process,  MH World would be the casuals hunter game and Wild Hearts would be those who want that extra Dopamine (the intense gamers).  This is all my opinion of course.

BUT now the game is on sale (if you dont have gamepass) it is THOUROUGHLY worth a go! Personally, despite the ire i will draw, I found it to be much more fun experience than both monster hunter world AND rise, of which i loved both dearly, and despite being labelled a \"clone with fortnite aspects\" before launch, it is different enough to be its own thing and Capcom could learn a thing or two here. Any \"mon-hun only\" person denying this game at least sets some new standards for monster hunter series is lying to themselves AND you!Now that the preface is over: for MOST people, the negative reviews can literally be chalked up too \"PC player doesn\'t want to take ACTUAL time with his/her settings, Has google chrome running with a few tabs open, and cant stand being at 59 frames instead of 60 and thus blames game\" Or simply \"REEE it\'s not monster hunter whats the popular negative review i can give\"I played this game in 2 states! First on launch with a 1070, Mixed settings, some high others low - mid (the usual suspects) In 4k resolution because i use a TV as my monitor (and 1080 On said TV looked blurry for most games so i defaulted to 4k) WHILST streaming! and yes i had the odd stutter but being a console player my whole life prior to making a pc 2 years after the 1070 launched. it didn\'t much phase me, i was still getting pretty good frames considering my 1070 being almost minimum requirements but i WOULD have to close chrome to do this! Another streamer friend i recently re-picked the game up with ALSO had stuttering issues and was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like crazy live...till he closed chrome, so take that as you will.I recently picked it back up with upgraded... and now its all max setting all the time and 4k and it\'s so good that now i can only complain about some in game mechanics!-The Karakuri system is GREAT but also in a team can become so spammable and oppressive to the poor monsters! So much so that i feel that celestial thread (the currency to build) should be harder to gain so that you have to REALLY plan what to use and when or be out of luck when you need it!-I wish there were more weapon options! 7 weapons types they do have are great and all feel different and unique (i exclude the 8th weapon type the cannon because i dont like its playstyle lol though im sure others will love it) and the way you can min max your weapon via the growth tree is PHENOMENAL, However, more types would be great! theres a distinct lack of a more \"tank\" weapon to utilise provoking perks (minus the umbrella which has a small parry window) so something with an outright shield would be good.-The lack of endgame is a bit of a letdown, even after the later on updates that trickled out (and i feel this is maybe becase of the tensions leading to ea supposedly dropping support) but there is still some content there but dont expect mon-hun DLC levels of extra story, just a few new monsters and even harder versions of ones you already faced!Despite all that I feel the MAJOR flaw of this game was the price! It was £70 and i FEEL that with the pre-release backlash, and the fact it was a new IP (and early more legitimate performance complaints) a £50 pricetag would have sufficed. I know EA said they stay out of the \"EA Originals\" titles more, but they CERTAINLY don\'t stay out of the pricing.I Honestly hope that If you CANNOT afford this game even on sale, that you will try it via gamepass, and if EA drop support some other, more monetarily/time forgiving company, will help them along because the devs really did a good job making this (despite any legit performance issues people have) and deserve a second chance even if you did suffer some issues...

In my recent playthrough, I encountered no performance issues, mainly slightly extended loading times, which I attribute to using an HDD drive. It\'s worth mentioning that I played this game on my robust 3D work/editing PC, which likely contributed to the smooth performance. Nevertheless, I\'m thoroughly impressed by this iteration.This MH- like  feels refreshing, providing a simpler and faster Monster Hunter experience enriched with fantastic features and numerous quality-of-life improvements. In the past, I often relied on external sources like the wiki to find specific items or understand their rarity across areas or monster ranks. However, this game conveniently offers nearly everything one needs to know directly within the in-game menus. It\'s an incredibly convenient addition.The standout feature for me undoubtedly lies in the weapons. Within the initial 20 minutes of gameplay, I was captivated by the aerial combos and the unique playstyles associated with each weapon. However, personally, I found the cord/string-knife less effective compared to, say, the hammer. Its damage output, particularly dealing a mere 7 damage in a 10-hit combo, pales in comparison to the hammer\'s potential 1,000 damage output. The choice between weapons becomes evident, especially during prolonged grinding sessions.Beyond the exceptional gameplay, the story proved captivating and engaging. At times, the pacing choices invoked a chuckle, like when the drunk character assures the village\'s safety, only for another character to immediately interject with catastrophic news. This slapstick-style humor injected a delightful element of entertainment into the narrative. The story itself showcases a blend of Japanese and Western cultural influences, with philosophy subtly woven throughout. While there aren\'t branching paths or significant choices impacting the plot, the variety in dialogue options adds depth to character interactions, encouraging further engagement.However, there\'s one glaring flaw: a sound design decision that truly grated on me. One particular armor emitted a high-pitched, metallic sound reminiscent of jewelry, which was incredibly bothersome. I opted to discard this armor, preferring a less effective one despite the higher risk in combat.so. game good. grab a partner play it in coop and have the greatest Monster hunter-like Experience i know till this day.

Especially as someone who typically purchases Call of Duty titles for a specific game mode. In this case, I would have only bought it at first glance for the zombies mode. I decided to purchase the title once the game had gone on sale for $48.00.𝐂𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐠𝐧Some may have enjoyed the campaign (although it is an unpopular opinion), but in my case, I did not enjoy this title\'s campaign. Compared to all of the Call of Duty campaigns throughout the years, this truly is the worst that has come for the franchise. The storytelling of the game did not retain my attention to continue on, as the missions had little to no originality and did not provide a compelling reason for why you are partaking in the adventure that the protagonists of the campaign are partaking in (if the description is vague, I do apologize as I do not want to include any hints of spoilers for those whom still would like to play for their first time without any knowledge of the story).𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫Bits and pieces of nostalgia arose when I played the multiplayer modes of the title. The mechanics are spectacular, as you feel a sensation of: \'freedom,\' being able to maneuver without the restrictions that were present in the previous title (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II). I do not concur with the reviews for down voting the game due to the presence of: \'Skilled Based Matchmaking\' (SBMM). A lot of complaints I hear about video games having SBMM: \"I just want to relax and casually win games against people that aren\'t sweats,\" \"it\'s harder for me to get clips\" (whether it is a content creator (small time/big time) or someone that just wants to show off). Games like Call of Duty are supposed to be competitive in my opinion, especially being an First Person Shooter (FPS) title. In my point of view, if you are being placed against people that are just as good as you or even better, that should be a motivating factor for you to improve - be better? It simply seems as if everyone nowadays just want handouts for subpar performance/quality.𝐙𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐞𝐬My first impressions were thrilling. Everything was new, different levels of zones was in a way, intimidating. For a solid 10 - 15 matches, it was great to catch on to little things I did not know about the game mode until I learned bits and pieces of information from someone else or through exploring. I would definitely recommend this game mode to hardcore zombies fans of the franchise, as yes, I understand that it does not follow the traditional style of the franchises\' zombies, but it is something new, and a good new, a refreshing experience for those who are looking for something different in zombies or burnt out on the previous franchises\' zombies. 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧On top of the fact that the title was retail priced at $70.00, consumers may opt to purchase the \'Vault Edition\' that came with the game for a total of $100.00+. I am truly failing to see how anyone producing this title believed that this would be satisfactory to any and all consumers of the franchise. It is clear that Activision no longer wishes to hide from the criticisms of many consumers for being a poorly managed company, built upon greed (added bonus: also being a company that has a history with tolerating sexual harassment, sexual assault, and inappropriate behavior in a workplace environment). I would not recommend this game simply because of the retail price of $70.00 because it does not meet the quality that deserves the preset amount. The campaign is subpar, everything within\' the game looks to be easily copied and pasted over, and the greed displayed through heavy focus of micro-transactions instead of focusing on the quality and originality of the game.

The counter prompts are off, not sure how they can continously do this, but least they keep that streak going right. In a game where countering is needed specially with the AI able to leap right to their feet with only a little stamina time after time, and recover swiftly when they don\'t auto jump to their feet. Not to mention being able to hit moves that you can\'t counter repeatedly, time after time. Like how hard is it to make sure your counter prompts are displaying at the appropriate time? Evidently impossible after all these years of making the same type of wrestling game they can\'t. Though once you get it down, or just keep getting lucky, the Y counter or triangle becomes fairly effective. Still won\'t help their autograbs, and moves where not even hitting the correct hold or attack button works. Which this is new to me, as not played a few of the WWE 2k games. not many I missed but evidently if they had this in the previous game I missed it.The make an entrance is just blah, I prefer the older ones, which were more in depth, and easier to use then the current one is. It\'s hard to set things the way you want them as you really can\'t pause (or if you can I haven\'t found out how to after staring at the controls for several minutes at a time, looking for the way to pause it.) The faces are great they look like the wrestlers for the most part, the mouths and mouth sync is as wonky as ever, kiiiiinda scary ngl. Still it\'s an improvement over some of the others. The wrestling except for the above prompts showing up to late to actually counter the move with is rather enjoyable.I do like the MyRise (haven\'t played anything else yet.) With interesting stories, still need to see if your choices actually matter, or if it\'s just the illusion of choice as in many other games. The fact I can play a female wrestler is great, with a good story, though not made it far I believe. Graphics are good, music is as ever fantastic. Button mashing for some things goes up at to slow of a pace, like I can kick out before a 1 count, but when they start dragging me to a corner and spose to press the B repeatedly it\'s not enough time, then of course it launches into a Y counter that the prompt ooooff course shows up to late to be useful. (yeah can you tell I\'m annoyed by the lateness of the prompt). Overall a game to while away the hours, though the amount of frustration does build when you hit get into some types of matches. the more opponents there are either against you, or in a tag team the more frustration builds as you really have to stun everyone most times in order to get a pin. If not someone always manages to get their in time (doesn\'t matter how low their stamina is, or how badly they are hurt it seems) they\'ll just pop right into the ring, while your fresher teammates move like they are in tar. still I\'d pick it up on sale, or if your looking for, or really into wrestling.',''),(2834,'More of the same.

I was rather apprehensive, about buying this title in the first place, in lieu of the innumerable negative reviews relating to the inadequacy of the translation, but to be perfectly frank, after a few hours of play, you quickly overcome any confusion pertaining to how mechanics work. The story is certainly in keeping with expectations for Wuxia, and anyone who has watched or played any title adhering to this structure will immediately recognize it\'s environment. I will grant that there are some nuances to play that you may only stumble across in the later game, which will enormously benefit you in terms of tackling some of the more challenging elements of this game, oddly enough that includes leveling up crafting, but if you\'re moderately clever, persistent, and enjoy the genre itself, it\'s rather hard to go wrong with this title. The combat is challenging, until it\'s not, and then you assume it\'s going to be a cake walk, until it isn\'t, so you you surmise that you\'ve plateaued, and there\'s no way to defeat certain enemies, then you have a breakthrough, possibly as much as a player scrutinizing your build and how to eek out every ounce of damage/defense as the character himself, and now that NPC is defeatable where they were seemingly invincible before. Looking at you Confucian Sect Leader (homeboy goes -hard-). The world is rich and vibrant, and there are a surprising number of sects and people to interact with, though admittedly some are less developed than others. Unlike wandering sword, there is less of an overarching narrative that cements your attachment to said characters, and the emphasis is more on getting what you personally want out of the game. If a sect rubs you the wrong way, wipe them out. If you adore them, join up, learn everything they have to teach you, and leave them in peace. The irreverent humor and overall sarcastic tone are highly enjoyable. The main character is an absolute dork, I love it. Oh, and the game is -exceptionally- stable, I haven\'t encountered a single bug or crash in 99 hours of play.The one area that will infuriate you if you allow it to, translation wise, is the various Confucian citations you\'re asked to complete--use a guide for this, they are extant on Steam.Overall this game is very much worth the asking price and very much worth your time.

I\'m maybe 1/3 of the way through the game, and I can\'t find the motivation to continue. Here are some reasons:Story: The game does not have an underlying story propelling you along - there might be one lurking in the back, but a third of the way in, I haven\'t found it yet. There are a series of seemingly random vignettes instead, which does not motivate me to continue. This wouldn\'t be a problem if exploration or character progression was better, but they are not.Open world exploration: the game is billed as an open world game, but it has a time system. At higher difficulties, certain enemies scale with time, which means there\'s a pressure to \"use your time wisely\", defeating the purpose of open world games where you should have the freedom to explore, experiment, and take risks on your own time.Region design: the game is broken into regions, but it\'s difficult, if not impossible to clear one region at a time before moving to another region. This is because enemies within a region vary tremendously in power Some quests in a region require a lot of grinding to complete, but by that time many other encounters in the region become trivial and a nuisance. The whole time you are left wondering if you\'re using your time wisely and whether tough enemies elsewhere are scaling faster than you are. Perhaps this is the game\'s way of forcing you to go to other regions and then come back, but there are much better ways of doing so, like allowing you to clear a region but then designing story quests that take you back to prior regions to face stronger enemies, etc. Because traveling between regions takes time, you\'re torn between trying to clear a region and going to other regions and coming back, not knowing which is the most efficient use of time.Character progression: there are a lot of attributes and skills in the game, but many don\'t feel relevant. For example, there are 5 identification skills that identify different giftable items. Imagine a game where if you wanted to identify a glove you had to learn the ID glove skill and if you wanted to identify a helmet you needed to skill up a separate ID helmet skill - but it\'s worse than that, because most of the items you are identifying can\'t even be used in combat - their only purpose is as gifts to NPCs, making these skills mostly nuisances that block progress rather than giving you a sense of real progression if you advance them. This is true of a lot of mechanics in the game.Crafting: again, this is a nuisance rather than something that gives you a sense of progression. There are 5 gathering skills and 5 crafting skills, yet only a handful of things you can actually craft. You can\'t really fully craft your gear because there aren\'t enough crafting recipes. Basic crafting materials are also hard to come by, so leveling up crafting is frustrating. Crafting also doesn\'t really give you any advantages over simply using non-crafted items, so the whole system is quite irrelevant and again, feels like it\'s there to block progress than give progress.This game has promise, but it needs some key design changes to really achieve its potential.',''),(2863,'错误的任务永远出现在错误的时间点...一开始选燕子窝，除了能偷东西啥武功也没有，战力约等于0 重开一档狼牙剑阁，一开始觉得还挺好，但是42级接了个什么鬼竞宝大会，好不容易攒够钱买了想要的东西，结束的时候突然来一伙人根本打不过...希望你们设计游戏的时候从玩家的角度出发考虑一下，动不动就要回档太恶心人了',''),(2864,'\"Is this all for a dog?\"I killed the whole village because of a dog.',''),(2865,'Hero\'s Adventure: Road to Passion mixes turn based tactics with an incredible amount of freedom to explore the world in the way, pace and order you yourself determine, get to know a large variety of different characters and recruit them to your party - or stay mostly solo.

It features a rich world with lore and dialog, however - especially riddles suffer from often odd mechanical and fan translations. The overall slow pacing might also be off-putting to some players. With better translations, the game would be a 9/10 from; right now I\'d give it 7/10, as the translation deficiencies actively hinder some playstyles (e.g., Wisdom as a stat can be improved through solving poem-riddles, which regularly do not make sense in their English translation).',''),(2866,'Incredibly good fun and a shockingly good set of translations! Sure, a little Engrish will come through every now and then, but nowhere near as much as most Wuxia games which seem to have an unwritten rule that they must be impossibly complex. The gameplay can be a little grindy at times but a lot of it can be automated (fights included) and set to 4x speed. There are a horde of open-world options like which factions to join, which waifu to marry (and you can marry multiple at once). And character creation is very involved and fun including loads of traits, stats, weapon types, super martial arts, and even talent trees. It\'s just a very complete and very fun game, though a small criticism would be that some weapon types and martial arts seem more \"complete\" than others, with more weapons and martial arts around them.

One of the things I enjoy in JRPGs is the interactions between characters so this was a bit disappointing- The side quests are all forgettable (basically all are fetch quests)On the whole, I definitely recommend this game for the combat system alone',''),(2871,'I went into this game expecting nothing more then pixel art eye candy. Instead got one of the highest quality games I\'ve played in a while and one that has permanently changed my opinion on turn based combat.The visuals of this game are stunning its everything you could hope for a AAA pixel art title. Animations are so abundant that NPCs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BLINK. This game really made me realize how much pixel art games rely on visually implying actions instead of animating them. Not to mention this game is full of sprites of all resolutions, you fan of classic 16x32 npc sprites well you get a ton of those, a fan of more modern massive 80x+ sprites well this game has more then I have ever seen in a game before. This title is next to flawless visually speaking I only saw 1 graphical bug and 1 case of clipping in my entire play through.But the combat system blew me away in this game more then anything else. I personally though turn based combat systems could never match the excitement, the adrenaline of its action combat counter part. Not that I dislike turn based combat it just has always felt more like a chess match then anything else. But this game slapped me in the face and called me an idiot. Not just does this have the classic min maxing you expect from turn based titles but it\'s fast paced, every character plays completely differently and the BP Guard and latent power systems make this game so satisfying to play. The boss battles also easily run away with some of my favorite in the genre, the music, story and gameplay come together to create amazing moments. And Throné\'s final boss had me laughing with joy at how over the top it was gameplay wise, easily becoming one of the most memorable turn based combat encounters I\'ve ever had.The stories are also all solid. Very much play into JRPG tropes but quite frankly if your looking at this game I doubt you have a problem with that. The character writing is super strong every character has completely different mannerisms both vocal and physical, which doesn\'t sound like much but so many games fail to do this, but when done it makes every character so charming to watch.I really only have 2 complaints.A: The party doesn\'t interact with each other much. The individual stories are strong enough I don\'t go crazy over this but the second you start doing crossed pathed missions you immediately go \"I wish there was more of this\"B: the final chapter isn\'t bad but its really short. The villains don\'t really get time to grow into their roll and it all just happens at once. Not to say it\'s bad whats written I actually quite like, this kinda grand plot tying 8 stories together as you see the subtle influence the big bad has had this whole time is really cool. It just needed more time to breath and because they didn\'t give it that it goes from a potentially great story to fairly average.That said those complaints are far from bad enough for me to leave a negative review this game is so fun and has attention to detail everywhere, and the sound track is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ killer, I haven\'t been satisfied by a sound track like this since playing Nier Automata last year. This title is a must play if your a fan of more traditional 2D RPGs or simply want to see the most visually appealing pixel art game in the industry.',''),(2872,'Let\'s get the non-bad things out of the way Graphics and sound fit, no complains there. Combat system is solid, progression system works....done. Now for the bad. In short: they have neither learned from nor improved upon the issues of the first game. Party Story There is neither. You have 8 solo characters that have absolutely nothing in common and that have virtually no interaction either. You have 8 mini stories that are outright crap. Stories are cut into chapters and intentionally made so you don\'t play 1 characters  story without interruption. There is no connection between either story and the chapter design is...sh*t. Enter area, get popup, confirm you wanna do the chapter, get hit by walls of text, use the characters path action at least once, get hit by more walls of text and occasionally you get to fight a bit...story chapter done. How low can the developers of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest fall ?... Path Action ..is like 90% of the game. Every single character story chapter revolves around the characters path action. There isn\'t a single side quest you can finish without using at least 1 path action, several can\'t even be started without. And even the skills for 2 jobs (inventor and armsmaster) are locked behind path action. This leaves you with the \"choice\": pick a party that has all relevant actions..or constantly switch members...but neither is actually an option. Choosing a party with all actions leaves you with like 1 party setup, constantly switching fails because path actions are not limited to towns where you can change party members and more (example at the end).  Adding day and night means you have 2 options for each result for day and night (e.g. 2x steal for day, 2x steal for night)...except it doesn\'t work. The game does not allow you to beat up children (sadnes...). The warrior\'s day action knocks out NPC blocking your path...by beating them up...can\'t use it on children. Can be worse... The priests night action gains information..by beating the NPC up...again can\'t use it on kids. Only way to get info from kids during the night is ...bribing them with the warrior which wastes money. Even better is the scholar who has a \"steal\" night action...by beating the target up. => not on kids. Only way to get items from kids during night time is the dancer...but her path action depends on her level. There is the next problem: only the characters in your active party get xp. So you can\'t just switch in the dancer for her path action...nope, you have to lvl her first. Example The promised example: A sidequest requires you to get a new lens for a lighthouse. Every normal game allows you to talk to the NPC and offer to buy it...not this pile of **. You have to use path action...and out of the 4 steal path action only the one from the merchant is allowed to be used. So you run back to town, switch in the merchant, run to the docks, board your ship, sail across the sea to the island, walk up the island to the lighthouse, buy the damn lens and go back to town to switch out the merchant.....truely great design....',''),(2873,'Classic JRPG with beautiful HD + pixel.

I wanted to play handheld. Streamig from my PC worked, but it looked like garbage and requires an internet connection. I have not played enough to judge the story or gameplay. I am going to play on Switch instead.',''),(2876,'This is a recommendation, but a hesitant and unenthusiastic one.As someone who really loved Octopath 1, I don\'t understand the people saying this is a straight upgrade over the first game at all. There are definitely minor improvements in gameplay and world design but in almost every other aspect, it\'s actively worse than the previous game in my opinion.The music is good, but it\'s a whole lot more generic and forgettable than the first game\'s soundtrack save for a few stand out tracks. The shared battle and boss themes in particular are just really boring. I\'ve 100% Octopath 1 twice and I never got bored of the kickass battle music, particularly the hype af Decisive Battle 2 and the amazing violins in Battle 2. I was tired of Critical Clash in Octopath 2 before I even got past the Chapter 1\'s. On top of that, the music placement just feels really weird in places? I went into a cave and fought a Level 20 plant miniboss and it played a track that sounded like it should be the final boss theme. I liked a few tracks like Partitio\'s theme, the Song of Hope and the actual final boss theme but I probably only really enjoyed 20% of the tracks while I really enjoyed around 80% of Octopath 1\'s tracks.The worst downgrade though are the stories and characters. I don\'t think Octopath 1\'s characters were notably well-written or anything (except Alfyn) but I liked all of them with the exception of Cyrus and enjoyed following their journeys through to the end. I actively dislike half of Octopath 2\'s cast and the other half with the exception of Partitio I\'d probably rank below all Octopath 1 characters except Cyrus. Hikari and Ochette have two of the most generic, forgettable and boring JRPG stories I\'ve ever experienced. I don\'t think it\'s possible to make a more generic JRPG protagonist quote than \"I fight for my friends\" but Hikari will not stop repeating it over and over again and Ochette has almost no character other than \"I LIKE MEAT\". Osvald is even worse, having one of the most hilariously objectively evil villains in fiction and they have the gall to try to spin it as him being \"obsessed with revenge\" while the objectively evil villain is going around sacrificing and experimenting on people for dumb evil reasons. On the bright side, his story gets so bad it\'s good near the end when he starts  shooting Kamehameha\'s everywhere using the power of love  (yes, seriously).I have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ they were thinking when they wrote Castti. I had high hopes after how great Alfyn was in 1 and it starts decently enough. She has amnesia and it plays with the idea that \"oooo, what if you have amnesia because you were actually an awful person or something\" and then immediately drops that by establishing her as the nicest person in the world in the next chapter and then  putting the blame for everything on one random dude in her group who went insane and started poisoning everyone for little to no reason. Agnea is okay but doesn\'t feel sincere and also feels like a worse version of Tressa from the first game. Throne has a good start and a surprisingly good ending but the middle is horrendously bad at points. Temenos is okay but feels like an absolute waste of a character because they never do anything interesting with the neat idea of a cynical and unfaithful cleric.Partitio was the only story I liked a lot. It\'s pretty cheesy and predictable but he\'s just such a fun and likeable character with a kickass theme and he gets probably the best written sections of the game in the form of a unique sidequest chain called the \"Scent of Commerce\". Despite these sidequests being basic and around 15 minutes each, they were some of my favourite parts of the game story wise and have some really cool rewards.I think my main problem with the characters is that most of them feel like main characters and in some cases are even explicitly \'special\'. I liked Octopath 1\'s characters because they were just random people on their own journeys which were mostly insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Octopath 2\'s characters feel like generic Gary Stu/Mary Sue JRPG protagonists.\"But they addressed the main complaint of the first game that there wasn\'t enough party interaction!\". They did, but it\'s a token effort. The absolute MINIMUM they could have done. Even putting my dislike for the characters aside, I was so disappointed by their implementation that I almost wish they hadn\'t bothered at all. The solution for the lack of party interaction that they executed was \"2 characters get a couple of boring 30 minute side stories together and don\'t interact with the rest of the party at all until the end of the game\". What this means is that Osvald and Partitio, for example, get a side story together but don\'t interact with anyone else in the party at all outside of random voice lines in battle. These side stories vary in quality but I wouldn\'t say any of them are better than \"passable\" and they\'re each an hour total in a game that took me over 70 hours to complete all stories. It\'s the smallest possible improvement.Overall, Octopath 2 feels bigger than the first game, but it certainly doesn\'t feel better. It feels like rather than expanding on the first game, they just stretched it out to take up more time and have more content while reducing the substance. If you like the gameplay a lot like I do, I\'d say it\'s enough to carry the game and make it worth playing. If you mostly care about the story and characters, it\'s not worth playing at all.',''),(2877,'huge improvement to the first one',''),(2878,'Legendary adaptation to the original- day and night cycle works seamlessly and adds variety to gameplay and party composition- using ship as added traversal is awesome, exploration in this game owns- BP and weakness system still function great ( bonus points for latent power + max BP animations ) - So many unique locations, encounters and bossesnegatives- cluncky pc controls definetly more accesible on switch but mind adjusts within an few hours- no difficulty setting- lot off random encounters/level/party grinding but its an JRPG nothing out of ordinary',''),(2879,'This is an amazing game!

The stories - All have great backstory, some gives a light tone (ex. Partitio, Agnea), but are stressful and dark (Castti, Osvald) Each have an individual story. A path they must walk, it\'s very interesting to see what they encounter.3. The Design - Bosses look so damn good, the characters we control look so damn good. 4. The music - WOW, just wow. It is unfortunate how underrated OT music is. The music perfectly fits each character, each scenarios, each battle so well. Sometimes it is the same music but with a different shade. A few great examples would be Agnea, Temenos, and Hikari.5. The combat - I thought turn based was kind of dying, but I guess I\'m wrong. OT2 did it perfectly, the hit sound, the charge sound. It feels incredibly satisfying, not too fast, not too slow.6. The graphic - The lighting is perfect in this game with its 2d/3d mixed. Resulting in greatness.What I did not like:1. Lack of character connection - Same as OT1, as each have their own story. The characters are together, but they feel so apart most of the time. Having side stories to connect them did not help so much.2. Side Quest: I personally find side quests in OT2 to be like finding an easter egg.

This game builds upon the already amazing core that Octopath Traveler was, arguably improving upon the story, fighting, character depth (with a few exceptions), and post-game. Of course, just like any game, OT2 isn\'t without its flaws, but everything that the game has done right shines so brilliantly that I can\'t help but put this game on a pedestal. The voice-acting was great (both the JP and ENG vas were for the most part, all fantastic. WHY didn\'t you make Temenos sound like a twink Square Enix :c). The world is beautiful. It feels like 2.5D pushed to its absolute limits in the best way possible. And the music? Wow. After playing many games of this genre, it truly is a gem to find a game that has music that checks off all the bars of \"sounds great, doesn\'t get repetitive, fits the atmosphere, and makes you *feel* something.\" OT2\'s OST has you covered on all fronts there. The turn-based fighting in OT2 is unironically the most satisfying and exhilarating combat system I\'ve ever played in a JRPG. By a long stretch. Can you make battles fast and feel overpowered without making the gameplay trivialised? Yep. Are there multiple unique battle mechanics going on simultaneously to make the fights more interesting? Yep. Can you run actual strategies with your four party members that feel great to pull off? Yep. Need I say more? I usually play JRPGs for the story, and fighting tends to be a by-product of getting through the story faster. However. I enjoyed every battle I fought in this game.

Its like if you bought a toy that was already expensive, but it comes without batteries and without a head.

With games like Injustice 2, if you bought the ultimate edition, you practically got everything, including the DLC characters. Calling a product \"premium\" when it is missing things is disingenuous. Besides, had there not been a sale, I would have paid $110 dollars for a game that comes with half the kameos. Overall, while the gameplay itself is fun, the overmonetization of this game makes it feel more like a pay to play rather than a game in and of itself. Do not buy unless on sale.

Too fast and it won\'t even register the button, and too slow by micro-seconds means the move doesn\'t go off either.

Sometimes it overwrites your input with the next move, and other times it does not. Invasions is interesting but not good enough to hold attention, and definitely not long enough for the high cost of the game.  Still no way to auto-skip fatalities in online play.  it\'s a feature people have been asking out of MK forever since no one wants to see the same fatality for the 100th time.

Compared to previous titles, this MK has extremely few combo starters per character, leading to repetitive combat. The roster is fairly limited, which didn\'t stop the developers from locking 3 base game characters behind pay walls. This game on its own is not worth the $70, but if you want to play as the main villain? 8 bucks. Quan Chi? 8 bucks. Ermac? 8 bucks and unreleased.

Activision annoying',''),(2913,'SingleplayerThe timeline of this series is set after BO1 and before BO2. Personally, I find the presented story very interesting, and the Cold War era is my favorite. BOCW also merges real-world characters or events with an epic fictional world, through history and the presented fictional narrative. It reminds me of the Assassin\'s Creed series, where real-world characters or events are combined with the game\'s fictional story.The narrative branching in this campaign adds significance to the story\'s progression, providing a reason to replay the game more than once, it\'s quite repeatable.The campaign gives off a vibe similar to BO1, where at the beginning, we are faced with intriguing mysteries, and as we progress, all the mysteries unfold, accompanied by some anti-mainstream plot twist.MultiplayerCompared to MW 2019, MWII 2022, and MWIII 2023, BOCW successfully achieves balance in each match. There are still many active players for online multiplayer, and we are matched with players of similar experience (perhaps the tryhard players have moved to MWII/MWIII), but they still exist and can be annoying at times haha. However, don\'t worry, it happens rarely.The weapons here are not as frustrating as in the MW series, I mean there are no shotguns used as snipers like in MWII, which is just absurd. Everything feels fair, although at the time of me writing this, the Tac-9 is the meta, and I\'m currently working on maximizing that weapon, and the process is just enjoyable.Most of the maps in BOCW multiplayer are also very familiar, especially for those who play CODM. A sign of a bad map is when you get killed from behind frequently, and it\'s hard to find enemies, you won\'t encounter those issues here.The MINUS is that sometimes it\'s difficult to find a lobby, whether there\'s an issue when joining a game lobby or joining a friend\'s lobby, but sometimes you get a lobby right away and it seems like there won\'t be any more content updates for this game.Note: A moderate NAT type is recommended.In conclusion, BOCW is suitable for a fun playstyle, much like the OG core loop gameplay of COD multiplayer.ZombiesTo be honest, I don\'t play it, so sorry, and skip for this one :)',''),(2914,'Better than mwii/mwiii',''),(2915,'multiplayer lobbies filled with modders ruining the fun in this game but althought zombie mode is extremely fun to play',''),(2916,'Game was automatically linked to an Activison account I haven\'t used in like 5+ years and no longer have access to.

Time for Ryza and friends to return, for one last summer, one last adventure...-- GAMEPLAY --New game needs new gimmick, to separate itself from the first game. Last game it was the ruins exploration, now it is the secret keys. It is  a really fun, creative new system, especially since it is incorporated in the story, it is created by alchemy and it has a lot of uses. The only downgrade is the rng, but at one point, you can mass produce more keys than a sweatshop factory, so it will not mater.Alchemy system also got updated, with the keys and the new link morph system,and, in my opinion, it became the best in the series.The combat did not change too much, but it became much easier than in the previous games, taking away a lot of the early game challange.Unlike the previous games, the game became open world, with load screens only between the big regions. And to be honest, this is not as good as i hoped it will be. Exploring the game world takes a lot of time and many times, you can\'t explore parts of the region, because you are constrained by not having specific traversal items, since you get them alter at the game. But, when you return to said area, it will feel like, waiting did not worth it, since everything you can find in these areas are basically the same tier, as other things in the region. So other than exploring a new cool part of the world, it is not too rewarding. Another big problem here, is that the world is empty. I mean, yeah there are treause chests (with meh treasures in them), and a ton of monsters and resource nodes, but that is it. No activities, just some random, radiant quests, but they become boring fast. YOu can get some secret recipies from treausre nodes but that requires you to have Super Rare keys, so again, it just adds to the late game grind.10/7-- GRAPHICS --This is where the game got the biggest  upgrade. It looks way better than the previous 2 games, while keepeing the same art style. 10/8-- SOUNDS --The music uses a lot of tracks from previous games, and some new tracks. They are integrated really well into the game world, and it always matches the mood of the game.Voice acting, well, japanese voice acting industry is on a way different level, than the rest of the world, so from a game series with budget like this, it is expected to be really great. Both returning and new voice actors are perfect matches for their charaters, and put their whoel talent into makeing them alive.The ambient and combat sound design is also a great match for the game. As in the previous installements.10/9-- STORY --The story is a perfect way to finish the Ryza trilogy. Wholesome, cute, funny, and it takes care of a lot of things, that were in the air sicne the first game.My only problem here is the ending. Without spoilers, basically it ends like the second game. We knew this is the last, but instead of a \"The end\" ending, we got one that feels more like \"The end?\" or \"To be continued\".10/8-- CHARACTERS --11 character main cast. This is the biggest in Atelier history. Our old friends, from previous games return, with new characters in tow. Their storylines all get some concolusion, and we see some minor characters make their return too, though they did dirty with Roma and Pamila, by making their quests like just they are some random NPC-s.My biggest beef here is Clifford and Serri. Other than some mentions, we do not see them return, other than being in the frame of the epilogue for 1 second. They were important characters, especially Serri to the oren lore. They would have deserved some closure, at least in the form of a quest or something.10/8-- WORLD && WORLDBUILDING --As i said, the game world became much bigger and open world. So there is a lot to explore and a lot of lore to learn, trough quests and hidden memoires. And, one of the biggest update here are the monsters. We get new monsters models, not just reskins of the old ones, which makes the game feel more diverse and interesting.10/8-- REPLAYABILITY --This was never a strong point in the series. There is new game plus, there is a harder difficulty that unlcoks after finishing the game once, but that is it. Well, it can be good to return, and replay the game, after a couple of years, to once again set off to an adventure with the characters, but, if you fully finish the game once, there is nothing new in a second replay.10/5-- BUGS & SUPPORT --Sadly there are some bugs. Though, if you look up online, you can solve the issues, so there are no real, gamebreaking ones.--TL;DR--Every farewell is a sad one, including this one. Atelier Ryza 3 is a pretty great concolusion of the series, but, looking at how successful the Secret series were, compared to other entries in the Atelier franchise, i would no be surprised to see the gang return in one way or another in either a new series or in a Ryza 4, the aftermath game...If you are a fan of the series, you will have a great time with this game, if you are new here, go and play the first Ryza game first.10/9',''),(2929,'Read the community forums.

I haven\'t played a new CoD since Black Ops II, and this is a review of the single player campaign only.I adore the original Modern Warfare trilogy. Mechanically this game is very similar to its predecessors, which are at this point over a decade old. The few advancements that are present are small, but welcome. Improved scope effects, the ability to mount your weapon on cover, and some novel night-vision sections. It\'s a mechanically competent FPS game, but so was Call of Duty 4, and this game feels an awful lot like its 16 year old big brother. It\'s also very short. Some of the missions can be completed in less than five minutes, and few last long enough to leave an impression. There are a few fun missions, but even at a steep discount I don\'t think you\'ll get your money\'s worth if you\'re only interested in playing the single player campaign. However, that isn\'t my chief criticism.The original Modern Warfare trilogy received some flak back in the day for its blatant and at times hamfisted attempts to up the shock value with each successive game. Going back and playing them after having experienced the harrowing nightmare that is Modern Warfare 2019 makes the absolute worst moments of the previous trilogy seem like a walk in the park by comparison. This game made me click through a disturbing content warning not once, not twice, but every time I booted it up, and for the first time ever I think it\'s actually warranted. Every level is No Russian. There\'s a war crime lurking around every corner. The game relentlessly ping-pongs back and forth between smooth FPS gameplay and excruciatingly realistic depictions of human suffering, and at times it even combines the two. If the cargo ship level from Call of Duty 4 were in this game all of the shipping containers below deck would be filled with underage refugees, and they\'d all go down with the ship begging for their lives as you heroically retreat to the helicopter.This game can\'t figure out whether it wants to be an action movie or a war documentary. On the one hand there\'s an argument to be made that military shooters shouldn\'t treat war like an amusement park, particularly considering how young their audiences can be, but on the other hand video games are fiction and their chief purpose is fun, and if it\'s not fun then why bother? And that\'s the worst part: this game, when it isn\'t wrenching control away to force you to witness some new atrocity, is fun. Never before has a grim treatise on the brutal realities of human conflict been so exhilarating. The medium is the message, and video games are for fun, so what\'s the message here? War is hell? Hell is fun? I\'m stumped.',''),(2941,'I just wanted to play the single-player campaign, with no interest in multiplayer features. Despite having an 80mbps internet connection, the initial 150GB installation consumed about three hours of my time.

The frustration continued when the game demanded my phone number, leading to an additional 30-minute delay. Upon finally reaching the main screen, I was confronted with excessive non-game-related content for the original Modern Warfare 2019 game I had purchased.While I eventually succeeded in launching the Modern Warfare campaign, I encountered difficulty achieving a 120Hz output. Frustrated by the complications, I decided to request a refund. A smoother installation process could have significantly enhanced the overall experience.

I like their Mignola-esque art style, the enemy design, the pacing of combats, their sound design, and OSTs. CotDG became my favorite Roguelike.There\'s a lot to like in Ravenswatch, mostly the diverse characters/playstyles available, but I want to give an honest review about the CURRENT STATE of the game. I might switch it to positive at the end of the EA period, but right now I\'m frustrated and I don\'t want to lure potential buyers like a fanboy.To put it simply, I think the game needs at least 3 times its current amount of content to feel like a complete, satisfying game and/or proper Roguelike.They\'ve been creative with the open-world roguelike formula; I admire that even if the UX is a bit poor, but I can\'t help myself but feel I\'m playing the first 20% of something that should be massively bigger. It\'s quite fun to play, but in some way, it plays/feels like an online Diablo-like, and if you consider all the similarities with that genre, it terribly suffers from the comparison.The progression system is very limited, and the gameplay lacks depth. There\'s barely anything to unlock, and in two games, I feel I\'ve seen nearly everything I could learn about a playable character. What a shame.As I said earlier, I love their core concepts, but the experience of playing them lacks depth and variables. Playing the nameless hero from Curse of the Dead Gods is more satisfying, diverse, and deeper than all the characters I tried from Ravenswatch. In Ravenswatch, I can just spam the same combos over and over, more or less. It\'s very repetitive, I don\'t have to think that much about the fights or the builds. CotDG was much more thinky than that.The other non-negligible problem currently is the fragility of the matchmaking. There are dead hours where you wait forever (without any feedback) to find teammates. You don\'t even know which settings you should select to increase the odds of the matchmaking. So you\'re forced to use the discord to find some players currently available to play on the difficulty you want. It sucks, and I suspect it will get worse halfway between the major updates. Yes, it can potentially improve, but the truth is that it\'s annoying RIGHT NOW.My suggestions for the future of this game:This game doesn\'t need new characters. It needs depth and real variety. I checked the roadmap and based on CotDG\'s lifespan, I suspect the studio doesn\'t have the funds to support the game for multiple years of content, which is unfortunate because the game aggressively needs more content. This is why I honestly believe additional characters should be (should have been) DLCs while the content updates remain free. This is the only way I can see Ravenswatch reaching its full potential. And yes, I would pay for every DLCs because these devs are good. It\'s just that the game needs A LOT more to keep the players engaged.Buy the game only if you want to support the dev team. Don\'t buy it thinking you\'ll get a solid gameloop that will keep you engaged for a while. It\'s not there yet.',''),(2970,'I really love the game so It pains me to put a thumbs down but I also want the game to be better so I want to provide my experience.I played Ravenswatch completely solo and never touched co-op so my experience is solely single player and I\'ve finished all difficulties with Beowulf, Aladdin and Scarlet.The gameplay itself is great. It responds well and once you get a rhythm down with your favorite character you feel like a well-oiled evil slaying machine, but I have 2 gripes that slowly grew into a complaint that slowly made me enjoy the game less and less. First is the 3 in-game days/18 minutes per area time limit, I get that time is of the essence evil is awakening and the heroes must respond theme of the game but I just hate being rushed since I\'m the completionist/take your time in a single area type of player so being rushed from point A to point B to Point C is something I personally don\'t like, while I know people enjoy that choose your upgrades/items to prioritize before the boss awakens I wish there was also a customization feature to allow me to disable the timer and let me take my time and enjoy the view or learn a new hero. Second complaint is that most talent unlocks after the base talent feels weak/made some heroes weaker e.g. Beowulf. I finished all the difficulties with Beowulf using his base talents and I loved his base kit, but after getting his new talent that enhances his shield abilities I just failed run after run not because it was a skill issue but because I got his talents that enhances the shielding instead of the usual power/special upgrade to my sword swings or spin attack and I get that\'s the point of roguelikes/lites you\'re just really gonna get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes whether you like it or not but having only 2 choices of talents every level up and adding more talents you don\'t want expanded the talent pool really took me out of it. Aside from those 2 main complaints I have I really like this game and I\'ll check it out every major update hoping for at least a custom mode to solve my whining.',''),(2971,'This is a tepid thumbs up from me, with a recommendation that you wait for 1.0 unless you\'re really a hardcore fan of the genre. The game is mechanically far along, but missing some UI tweaks, story, tooltips, skill unlocks, map variation, boss variation, less grinding, better difficulty modifiers, and more that will make the game feel much fuller.You should be sure you know what you\'re getting too. This is a roguelike in that there\'s permadeath, but there\'s not a lot of random variation between runs. In Binding of Isaac, there\'s a chance you\'ll become god -- that\'s not really the case here. Instead, one run you\'ll have a better-than-average Power attack, the next run you\'ll have a better-than-average Defense. It\'s a bit like Hades, but with even less run-by-run variation.The main variation isn\'t random, but in choice -- you have a bunch of heroes to come from. These heroes are really, really well-designed and fun to play with, with a lot of interlocking systems and a high skill ceiling. The combat is phenomenal -- much better than Hades, in my opinion. If there\'s a downside, the lack of variation within runs means the beginning eventually becomes a bit boring, instead of exciting to see what happens.This is made worse by the map standardization. There\'s always everything in the map -- always two optional bosses, always three chests, always a wishing well. This makes things tight in the sense that RNG is relatively minimal (but still there) -- but I personally find it a bit dull, and I hope this changes in 1.0.You also don\'t feel in control of your character\'s development in this game. Shops sell \"5% damage boost\" twice, or you can upgrade a skill for 5% increased damage -- not very exciting, and not really impactful until near the end of a run once they start adding up. There\'s also no reroll system for perk selection, so as you unlock more and more items, you have less and less opportunity to steer toward a build -- you just take what you get. You can order how you complete events, or try to collect cursed items, but overall I was surprised at how little control I had.Similarly, there\'s no positive meta-progression, just potential traits unlocked, which is fine -- but there\'s also nothing else either: you don\'t unlocked maps, events, cosmetics, banishes, story, and so on. Right now, there\'s just a crazy grind to unlock all the possible traits for a single character. Several hours for each of the nine characters to unlock everything? I think they can come up with a better endgame system to keep dedicated players going, while making the unlocks faster for the rest of us.There were plenty of things I thought this game did well. In addition to the combat, the art style is nice, and the sound design (and especially voice acting) was really better than it has a right to be. But it tends toward a \"no fun\" design philosophy, with a dull map overcrowded with enemies you learn to ignore, and a general lack of vision outside their gameplay loop. So again, it\'s a tepid thumbs up -- but unless you\'re deeply interested in the gameplay, there\'s really no reason to not keep it waitlisted until 1.0. It\'s also not something I\'d recommend playing before other games in the genre, like Hades. (Note that I only played this game single-player, and so can\'t speak to how it feels in co-op.)',''),(2972,'great game, everyone should try',''),(2973,'I\'m pretty confused about why this game doesn\'t have more buzz. Compared with other early access games it\'s really polished. I like games like (older) Diablos, Path of Exile, etc. But I don\'t want to deal with lots of weird microtransactions, having to watch a video with spreadsheets to make a character, etc.There are so many lame time wasting junky diablo likes that are just microtansaction machines. (Diablo IV, Torchlight online, all the Eastern action rpgs, etc). PoE is slightly better but it\'s basically just a skinner box for hardcore players who can spend 80 hours a month (and the campaign is torture).This is just good clean fun. You log in, you play a game, it\'s really smooth, there are no issues (I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a bug).Also, unlike recent diablo games, this game will kick your ___. You start the game and basically just die. It\'s not wasting your time. There is no 30 hour tutorial that you can play before the game gets slightly challenging. I started (maybe 6 months ago?) and I thought... \"this game is nuts, why is it so hard\". But the moment to moment gameplay was so crisp I went back for more. I had more fun losing in this game than \"winning\" in other games. And the cycle repeated. I couldn\'t unlock new characters because I couldn\'t beat the 1st boss for months. I now have everything unlocked and have completed the game, which felt completely unachievable even a month ago.(For the record I\'m old; I don\'t normally play dexterity games, I have a job and family, play infrequently and play on the steam deck with a controller; so I don\'t think the game is especially hard if you\'re really good at these games. But it\'s not a joke like the diablo games where you can play for hours without having a challenging moment)ProsArt style is really goodThe character voice lines are excellent (especially Beowulf and his wyrm)Gameplay is crisp and smooth (on steam deck haven\'t tried other platforms)Works great on controllerThe characters are really different from action rpg staples - the novelty is really appealing but there is no wizard or warrior or anythingThere are multiple paths to victory; depending on the items and talents you find different character builds work wellThe systems are a bit opaque, which gives it a surreal fairy tale vibe where I find it tricky to min-max (how useful is that lucky clover? which legendary item is useful?) it\'s a bit vagueThere are no bs microtransactions. You beat the game your reward is to play the game again, but on a harder difficulty.The UI is beautiful and uncluttered. There are no timed challenges or other junk. There is no meta currency. If you play with a character you get to unlock more things for that character and that\'s it. It\'s perfect.ConsThe systems are a bit opaque (it\'s a pro too but). I had an item that gave me more damage for each dreamshard so the run where I finally beat the game I was running around with 700+ dream shards. Was that good? Or should I just have bought 700 shards worth of items from the vendor? No idea.Needs more Content--Objectively there are a lot of monster types but they do get a bit samey if you play a lot. Some of the monster families repeat in Act 2 which made me a bit sad. Of course if you don\'t learn their attack patterns you will die so probably there is a trade off.--There should be more side quests (there is 1 per act right now) - they\'re hard, so a lot of times you don\'t succeed but some variety (where you get one 1 quest per run randomly) would be better--Some of the talents are overtuned (cough, laser eyes, cough)--The character who is easiest for old people with no dexterity to play (Geppetto) is not available initially; so old people have to play the hard characters first to unlock instead of just cruising around - j/k this is a pro',''),(2974,'Wait for devs to fix desync problems if you intend to play co-op',''),(2975,'It delicately scrathes that itch that was left by Dead Island Epidemic so many years ago...

I have played a similar game that had more variety of skills and more dynamic maps from run to run in Darksburg. I just hope the developers here keep with it and can add more to the game and surpass Darksburg with content and variety, but that is a low bar as the developers abandoned that game after completely reworking it from its base form.TLDR: Not a lot to this game outside playing the same maps on harder difficulties or with new characters.

Overall, this is just a bad experience. 3/10',''),(2994,'Pretty game with some of the worst combat I\'ve ever experienced. I hate that games can look this good and still have such bad mechanics. The character models look good but the uncanny valley is strong here. NPCs feel like mannequins. No movement, no life. There are games like this that feel better to play. More rewarding. Pressing \'F\' to salvage things or cut trees down needs to feel like more than pressing F. You only have an arm when you\'re wielding an item. You have no legs. You are just a disembodied restless soul roaming around pressing \'F\' to salvage entire sunken cars. Speaking of using items, why can I only wield one item at a time? Did my character lose one of his arms when he spawned into the world? I tried to equip my ax in one hand and the torch in another and it was not happening. If you can, it is not readily available. Seeing as you don\'t need sleep and the \"Simple Bed\" costs more materials than i ever had on me I just found myself waiting in the dark until the sun came back up so I could jump back in the water and dig around in trash. As for survival mechanics, You get hungry and thirsty and will die if you run out of air. You don\'t need to sleep as far as I could tell though I never actually slept, I just played for several in-game days straight. Hopefully it passes time or at the very least restores your health bar but I can\'t say it does either of those. When you\'re injured you can make bandages for immediate use but the cost in cloth is too expensive. You got a stamina bar. It works as intended. Cooking is fine. Nothing to it, just throw the food on the grill and forget about it. It doesn\'t burn and once its done it becomes lootable. Not rewarding. Researching things requires specific materials, once you have them you can immediately research a new item. Doesn\'t feel rewarding. Base building has the basic snapping square grid system seen in other games like this. The exception is that you cannot flatten the land to build, their attempt at working around this was to create foundations that work fine but again, this is done better in other games. Most rewarding aspect. I requested a refund after I farmed up materials to make a row boat thing. I get on it and start rowing and this giant ugly interface pops up as an overlay and shows me the controls for operation. Suddenly, my screen is cluttered just to tell me to press \'WSAD\' to move directions. It doesn\'t go away its just there and to make matters worse, the sound effects used to row are grating. In a game about being a survivor in Waterworld you would think the boat driving mechanics would feel responsive. Valheim does this far better. So, I row my boat up to the little trader lady\'s floating shop and make a few trades in their pleasing trading and bartering system. I buy what I need and sell some trash and I\'m ready to bounce back to the cribbo. I hustle back to my parked rowboat and hop back in. I parked it facing the trader\'s shop but far enough away to just turn around...or so I thought. However, as I turned left and began to row the boat was suddenly caught by the undertow riptide of a glitch that pulled me and my rowboat under the shop and permanently stuck looking at the trader\'s massive mommy milker\'s upside down through the clipped floor she was standing on. That\'s when I checked the time on how long I had been playing and it read 99 minutes. I really like that there are vendors and NPCs and enemies. But it all feels so skeletal. Like 25% of a great idea realized. It\'s a shame too because it has a lot of great ideas. Cut down the price and refine the gameplay a lot. Combat sucks so bad. Tasks are boring to do.

The multiplayer is alive, and there is even a multiplayer car upgrading part of F1 23, where you can get parts and members to your team and use their abilities in your races, this is called F1 World. It can give you challanges, where you can get additional parts, resources to upgrade and craft these componenets and collectibles, which can give some challanges for some of the players. There is of course the regular multiplayer racing with the well known F1 and F2 teams. The game however does have some bugs, which can make your races annoying or even break it completely, not even mentioning the unstable EA servers which can make your multiplayer experience horrible, due to the lag or desync issues, sometimes even disconnecting the player. Also, F1 World content feels compeletly useless, if you only want to do multiplayer races without any collecting.In my opinion F1 23 has its ups and downs and from a more casual point of view this is a likeable game, however it still has some old bugs and new issues which makes the game a bit disappointing, but I think you should give it a chance for around 30 - 25 €.',''),(3007,'TU TU TU MAX VERSTAPPEN',''),(3008,'Maybe the best Formula 1 game I\'ve played.

I’ve played most of the F1 games over the years. Just for context, I may be 70 but I was involved in ‘real’ motorsport from my teens – and quite good. On the computer (I have a very decent rig and high-end PC) I’ve got very close to world records. This week I recorded a pole lap of 1:16.62 in Australia (now my 3rd full season in F1 23), which ain’t too shabby I think. I have competed in thousands of races and I’m now at 243 hrs in F1 23. All this is said to hopefully indicate I ought to know how to race (but I know many will have laughed at a 70-year-old racer! I understand).Now to F1 23. Like many I found the cars in F1 22 very tricky to drive, very understeery and the A.I.  ‘challenging’. These issues were said to be resolved in F1 23; that was my experience when I began racing in F1 23. Initially I found it a joy compared to F1 22. That was for my first two 23 race seasons.Bizarrely, I’ve just completed 3 races in a 3rd season, and the car is behaving differently. It feels, oddly, as if F1 22 characteristics have crept back in. Less predictable handling and more understeer – and my set-ups are well developed and work. Also, the A.I. seem to have become more erratic again. They are set to 70, which I know is not very high, but age has its limitations!And just to cap what had been a very challenging Australian GP – in this 3rd series – the car suffered a sudden terminal failure of the MGU-K. That means a total DNF failure during only the 3rd race!! That has never happened to me before in the huge number of races I’ve competed in. There was no warning (other than just before the actual failure) and I had checked all car systems status before the race. All OK. As for the cars status, I have all ‘Performance’ (& durability) mods maxed out, all ‘Facilities’ mods maxed out and morale is ‘High’ in all depts. But that all seems to count for nothing in terms of durability if the car breaks after less than 3 races completed!My experiences in F1 23 during these first 3 races into my 3rd season have drained me of enthusiasm for this game.

There are a few things that prevent it from reaching the heights of greatness:- Your units can only shoot in A SINGLE DIRECTION from trenches, meaning if you capture an enemy trench, your soldiers will face YOUR TRENCHES and will be unable to shoot at enemy troops. This is utterly unacceptable in a game based on trench warfare. Until this issue is fixed my review will remain negative.- Suppressive barrage prevents ALL firing. Instead they should reduce firing efficiency, not prevent your men from shooting entirely.- Speaking of firing, it should be much easier to tell if your units are actually shooting. Sometimes I will see the target icon appear but I can\'t tell who or where they are shooting. Sometimes it doesn\'t even look like they are at all.- Battalions get wiped out WAY too quickly. This is partially justified because WWI, but even at the beginning of the game when it\'s entirely bolt action rifles your battalions will be destroyed in a matter of seconds.- There is no way to undo an order on the campaign map, leading to one misclick quite literally having the potential to ruin your entire game.The first issue is paramount and I am kind of miffed at why the game has been out for nine months and it still hasn\'t been fixed.

Battles take place on what can charitably be called 10 maps, which is a problem because there *is* a dominant strategy. If you know anything about WWI, you know that sitting in your trench and *never attacking* is the correct move. To its credit, this game gets correct in a neat historical fashion. The problem is that you learn to just sit back and let the enemy fight into you, even when you are attacking. Yes. This is how WWI was fought, but it doesn\'t make for interesting gameplay. I got to thinking about this and began wondering if there even *is* a way to make a WWI RTS game *fun*. WWII games can be fun often due to the volatility of the situation. WWI is so static that even major advantages on either side were often nullified by virtue of trenches with modern rifles being historically defensible.Also, the game macroeconomy is kind of terrible? Like, I played as the Entente and won the game in 1915 (!) by bankrupting Germany (!!) because the AI kept attacking me over and over. I didn\'t need tanks, gas shells, aircraft, or even infantry helmets.

In my next playthrough, I focused on gas attacks via artillery (aka mustard gas), and found that to be a very effective way to win.  I have barely scratched air craft and tanks, so hopefully that gives me even more hours of fun.My biggest complaint is the game focuses too much on the \"Great Victory\" to take land in the game.  I would rather that even minor victories move you closer to your goal, even if it took a lot of them.  I would also prefer if the goals assigned to you were toned down a bit.

First of all, it\'s a game from Ubisoft, so the design of open world map set in Washington (including sub-maps) and the character design itself are excellent. Definitely, Ubisoft never disappoints us from this field. And it has somewhat intelligent AI in combat compared to other games. The gameplay hasn\'t changed much from the previous one(Tom Clancy’s The Division™). I\'d say Tom Clancy’s The Division® 2 itself is good. However, it\'s a typical \"Pay-to-Win\" game with 100% bullet sponge enemies. Because of the high dependence on items, it means that in theory you cannot kill an npc with a low-quality gun even if you hit its head 100 times, and you\'re actually going to experience it. Playing this kind of less-reality game was a really bad experience for me. Moreover, forced real-time Ubisoft online connection is so annoying and frustrated. The problem is that the quality of Ubisoft online connection is very low, and considering Ubisoft\'s notoriety for \"Play while you can\" server operation, it\'s the worst part. Furthermore, its story wasn\'t interesting at all because the story took most from the first one(Tom Clancy’s The Division™) and made it feel like a rehash. Now, I’ll briefly list the pros and cons of this game.Pros- Very Detailed and sophisticated map design- Continuous support and new content development until now- Somewhat superior and intelligent AI in combat compared to other games- Very detailed character and weapon customization- Great SoundtrackCons- Pay-to-Win game. Hard to enjoy the game without buying in-game items because of lack of items and supplies even though I bought the Ultimate edition,- 100% Bullet Sponge enemies guaranteed! The overall balance between enemies and my weapons was terrible! Enemies don’t die even if they gets hit by a head shot.- 24/7 Forced Ubisoft Online Server Connection.(Ubisoft is notorious for its \"Play while you can\" online operation. Not sure what will happen after the server shuts down.)- Poor story and characters & too short and easy(meaningless) campaign/singleplayer missions- Feel like somewhat downgraded version of the previous game(Tom Clancy’s The Division™) in terms of its map design(Open-world elements), story and campaign.ConclusionThe game itself is fine, but I personally don\'t like Pay-to-win games with bullet sponge enemies, lack of reality & storyline, forced online connection etc as a single-player user. And compared to the previous game, the quality is relatively low in terms of its map design and story.

Everybody was just repeating the same stupid and boring mission over and over again, just to get that stupid pistol, glove or vest of the set you preferred, with an additional point in gearscore.I started a completely fresh run.

If it is a tactical game, for the love of God, just give me all the gear I need at the start, what is the point in making me CHOOSE what class I want? the level-up system is just as ugly, like for the Panther class you have to disappear from enemies\' sight with your smoke screen special ability. What if I don\'t intend to be seen at all, like if I\'m doing a full-stealth/ghost build? the systems feel unrefined and rushed at points, like it exists just for the sake of needing to add a progression system- the AI is SO bad it\'s not even funny, the NPCs get stuck on tree trunks, and take ages to spot you even on the hardest difficulty, it really breaks the immersion- speaking of immersion, there is NONE, i followed countless guides on \"THE PROPER WAY TO PLAY TC:GR BREAKPOINT\", and it DID NOT help- the controls and the lack of keybind tutorials. I won\'t elaborate further, just get the game and open the control scheme, it is so bad I still can\'t wrap my head around it - it\'s buggy and feels VERY rushed- do not even get me started on the online-only mode and the Ubisoft launcher, there\'s enough said about that, as you can imagine, it is as bad as people say- the game is EMPTY and feels like you\'re playing a demo if you didn\'t get the expansion packs. From what I\'ve seen, as I didn\'t get the standard edition, there is a paywall and I can\'t fathom it. The audacity to charge $60 USD as a full retail price is crazy- the first 2 hours of gameplay feel like slightly more advanced guerilla ops as you have NO gear besides a silenced pistol and whatever you grabbed from the enemies you kill. seriously, the game starts with a 10 minute run and the enemies pose NO threat, because, as I said, the AI is trash. The looter-shooter aspect is warzone-ish in the most horrible way possible. You just run around opening crates with a lot of stopping power, and none of it is great or even good- the lines NPCs repeat over and OVER AND OVER again makes me feel like Ubisoft really made NO progress since the early Assassin\'s Creed titles which is a completely different topic for discussion- the drones. I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hate them- special enemies like the heavy are more of a nuisance than a challengethere IS a reason it\'s always on discounti only spent 1,5 odd hours in this game, but it felt like a lifetime, just because it was so damn boringthe game feels cheap and unbelievably generic as if you got a CD copy of some no-name dev\'s debut title for 50% off in the gaming aisle at your local storeUbisoft\'s season pass/DLC BS is pissing me offalso, why should I give the game 3-5 tries until it gets fun?do NOT buy this game for its full priceif you get the game expecting to get a tactical milsim experience, in that regard similar to Arma etc., prepare yourself for the most mediocre game you have experienced in a while, same goes for stealth-action fansalso I never tried co-op, that makes me feel like the only way to really have some fun in this game is to play it with a friend or a groupin conclusion, to be honest, I hated every single moment I spent playing breakpoint, it really crushed my hopes and expectationsthe only positive notes I can really admire is the visuals, the graphics, e.g. the lighting in this game is impressive, but besides that it\'s just an asinine arcadish kind of battle-royalish gameside noteas a fan of Splinter Cell games I feel incredibly underwhelmed by the DLC they provide with the Y1 pass, it\'s NOT funjust please give us the Splinter Cell remake for Christ\'s sake',''),(3143,'Feel like Wildlands was a bit better.

One of the major drawbacks is the lack of a compelling and memorable main character. The absence of a strong protagonist undermines the emotional engagement that is crucial for a narrative-driven game.The Recruitment system, while innovative, can feel more like a gimmick rather than a meaningful addition to the gameplay. Many of the recruited characters lack depth, making it challenging to form a genuine connection with any of them. This results in a sense of detachment and indifference towards the fate of these interchangeable figures.The story, touted as one of the game\'s selling points, struggles to maintain a consistent level of excitement and originality. The narrative often devolves into a predictable sequence of missions, and the stakes never feel particularly high or impactful.Technical issues and bugs have plagued the game since its release, hindering the overall experience. From graphical glitches to AI problems, these issues can disrupt immersion and frustrate players.Furthermore, the game\'s open-world design, while visually appealing, can be overwhelming and lacking in variety. The different districts of London may look distinct, but the activities within them often feel repetitive, contributing to a sense of monotony.In conclusion, Watch Dogs: Legion fails to live up to the expectations set by its predecessors. The lack of a compelling protagonist, underdeveloped recruited characters, a predictable storyline, technical problems, and a somewhat monotonous open-world design make it a disappointing addition to the Watch Dogs series.',''),(3183,'Too bad I can\'t play this game because WD 1 and 2 are perfectly fine.

There\'s no reason not to add Steam achievements with their new games other than to punish Steam players for not buying the game directly from Ubi.2. While none of the bugs are game-breaking (so far), the amount of bugs is unacceptable for a company with the budget and resources that Ubisoft has. Still, I\'ll continue playing and enjoying it, happy that I only paid €10 for it. As I said, it is overall a fun game. I do think that they were lazy in a lot of aspects.

A lot of fun and varied ways to traverse this beautifully made map. If you haven\'t guessed yet; freeroam is easily my favorite aspect of this game.You can also participate in races called events against CPUs, winning these will get you exp for the relevant career. Leveling your career up will reward you either with better gear or bucks you can spend on outfits. These outfits are on weekly rotation. While tastes are subjective I think there\'s plenty of good outfits you can earn for free. You can also earn gear and outfits from completing sponsor challenges.Beyond this there\'s a lot more activities you can participate in like online Mass Races and Trick Battles. There\'s also Daily Sponsor Challenges, Weekly Challenges and Weekly Shop Rotations making you almost never run out of reasons to play even after finishing the main game.DownsidesThe game opens up with a tutorial and cutscenes, you\'ll quickly notice this game is a little cringeworthy, but that only makes up a tiny percentage of your playtime. The dialogue in general is a little cringeworthy, but again it only makes up a small percentage of your total playtime. The music isn\'t really good in my opinion, different strokes for different folks I guess. You can disable the ingame music, still use the other sound effects while playing your own music in the background.Events are in my opinion the weakest part of this game, because it\'s an open world game it has to confine you to the intended area and route somehow. Basically keeping you from taking shortcuts during races or earning trick points in unintended locations. Their less than elegant solution is to put checkpoints every 30 feet. If you miss a checkpoint during a race you can kiss your victory goodbye. While an alternative solution is hard to come by, at least make the checkpoints less frustrating to deal with, I\'ve lost tons of races just because I missed and arbitrarily sized checkpoint.There\'s also little incentive to try if you can\'t make it into the top 3 as 4th till 12th (last) get the same rewards. I know it\'s supposed to reflect medals in real life, but from a gameplay perspective it makes little sense not to just make it more incremental. However once you have your gear you can mostly avoid events in the bulk of your playtime.MonetizationThis is basically an MMO so it should be considered a live service game and should be treated as such. Premium outfits shouldn\'t be considered any more or less taboo in this than other live service games like ESO or Warframe. Doing so is kind of a double standard. This is a game that gets regular updates and DLC. The developers need to be paid to get us that content.I preface this because the game seems to catch a lot of flack for selling outfits for real money exclusively, However compared to other monetization schemes Riders is arguably one of the healthiest ones. I\'d argue it\'s a really good example of how monetization should be done.They\'re confident enough you\'ll enjoy the DLC items, they let you playtest them for free so you can make an educated decision whether you want to buy them or not. There are no lootboxes or fomo items as about half the seasonal Premium outfits can be bought outside their featured week and there\'s no pay-to-win at all. Even the bought currency isn\'t purposefully inconvenient as the incremental amounts you can buy are usually exactly what you need for a set number of outfits.',''),(3234,'If you just want to have fun then this game is for you.I agree with other people the game does require lots of other DLC if you want skateboards and BMX\'s and stuff, but if you just want to ride bikes and stuff then this game is for you.I personally like this game a lot because it\'s ton of fun.',''),(3235,'Best game ever',''),(3236,'Bikes snow and skating',''),(3237,'Wäre ja nicht mal schlecht aber meiner meinung ist es eine anmassung die hälfte der Sportarten in dlcs (die echt teuer sind) zu packen ausserdem ergeben die pysics oft gar keinen sinn bin sehr entäuscht',''),(3238,'I have never talked to a woman irl',''),(3239,'This is at once a surrealist masterwork, a sexist male power fantasy, a geniune deliberation of romance and a well of existential dread.This was recommended by a friend, they said I might like it, though I believe for the wrong reasons.I laughed out loud so often, sometimes because the jokes are nice, sometimes because of the sheer absurdity of it and sometimes out of joy, because the actors are so sincere.The acting is way better than this game deserves.

Now, the important thing for the Dev team will be to keep on bringing new content, maps, enemies, items. The gameplay itself shouldn\'t change much. It\'s just content at this point.

The game doesn\'t have any voice overs/actors, but the characters are written so well that I can hear their voices by reading their dialogue texts. The chemistry between them is great and I really enjoyed the humor.I hope that the developers add more maps and enemy types with the final release because although I love the gameplay, there isn\'t enough content to justify it. The endless mode is desperately needed and the waves need to be randomized.It\'s also worth mentioning that all the characters except the knight need a buff. The assassin needs a health buff, the mage needs a speed buff and etc.The game also needs to give the player the option to pick two more starting skills besides the usual dash. I really liked Kangaroo (3 dashes) for example, but I only picked it up once because it\'s very rare to encounter it. The player must be able to keep these skills as a reward if they are to return victorious from the final battle.Some gods are actually unbalanced. For example; Lady Justice is overpowered which is good and I don\'t mean that I would like to see her nerfed. However, I would want other gods to be buffed to be as powerful as her.

I never felt like I could craft interesting synergistic builds with what I was offered. It all just felt like: \"make number go up, very slightly\"-Hades style boon system does not really make sense if player doesn\'t have a choice in what will be offered-movement penalties while attacking are unfun and I\'m gonna die on that hill-some enemies will straight up run you down before you find epic boots + movement speed upgrades and there\'s nothing you can do about it whenever your dash is on cd-only 1 level right now-not a fan of bind on equip items, this just seems like a restriction to increase the grind / playtime, but not in a fun way-no real innovation on the formula and therefore no uspUndecided:-no run of the mill meta progression where you upgrade dmg / as / area / range etc. incrementally. Let\'s be honest that\'s boring as hell at this point-\"meta progression\" instead tied to equipment, which is restricted by class specific gear and \"bind on equip\"-quite a lot of utlity is tied to gear now, like pickup radius, boon rerolls / banishes, luck etc.I think the most important aspects of this genre are fun rewarding gameplay and replayability enabled by depth and build variety.

As someone who has played the past Diablo (3) , I’m not saying this is the best one. But I’m not saying it’s not enjoyable and just an overall good game. I have enjoyed this game just as much as the other, and I admit that I am addicted to it which I wouldn\'t have thought I would say.

The gameplay loop is pretty fun, I can see why the series is popular. It\'s grindy in a fun mindless way, and it\'s a good movie/podcast game. But the focus on multiplayer and monetization hampers it. I just wanted to play this single player, and you can\'t as it\'s always online. It shouldn\'t be deck verified for that reason alone. It\'s not really a handlheld game to take on a flight, you have to have wifi. Even if you play solo. You can\'t pause the game for this reason either, so if you have to get up frequently or put games to sleep, this one isn\'t it for you. The game seems like it was once a good game, and then they in modern fashion stripped away all rewards and incentive for playing and charge for it. I got this for 40 dollars and beat the main story, with one character. I didn\'t do any of the post game and only did maybe a third of the side quest. You are bombarded with ads frequently, every time you unlock some tier, or to go to the map, there is an ad asking you to buy an overpriced cosmetic. The armor and stuff you unlock in game all looks the same, incentive\'s you to buy the predatory monetization cosmetics. I paid 41 for this game on sale. I truthfully think it\'s worth maybe 30 in it\'s current state , maybe less. I played at a leisurely pace and beat the main game and a 3rd of the side quest in 37 hours, solo.. If you\'re playing with friends, you might get more value out of it and beat it faster or replay it, but I play single player because as a 32 year old with a weird schedule, it\'s hard to find time to party up with friends, and most of my friends don\'t play this type of game, and I\'m too much of an introvert to add strangers and play.

It is much better than Diablo 3, in terms of gameplay and story. It\'s less simplified than Diablo 3 (although the voice acting is simpler), has the appeal of Diablo 2 (not cartoony, dark story), and similar atmosphere and world-building to Grim Dawn. The story is actually engaging though it\'s slow. The map is open-world and scales with your level, and even though the terrain can get repetitive at times, many unique biomes are introduced to make up for that.The music, I dunno if everybody forgot what Diablo bgm sounded like but it sounds like this game.In terms of loot, you get legendaries pretty quickly so the game also introduces crafting early, and that makes builds much more accessible. If you don\'t get the gear you want, you can basically buy it (although it picks a randomr tier) through murmuring oobols- you get these by doing quests and events. It is also easy to refund skills. Just spend some gold (which you also get an abundance of).I don\'t care much for the online stuff in Diablo 4. Apparently, Blizzard made this game online-only to prevent cheaters in PvP. I don\'t play PvP, and I\'m not sure about everyone else but I\'m not playing these types of games for the PvP. And because it is online-only, you will get network issues and ping spikes even with \'faster than average\' internet. The game also forces you off the servers when you afk for like 10 minutes.That being said I recommend Diablo 4 if you played every other ARPG out there.

None of it feels like it has lore or significant impact. The excitement for new gear drops real quick. Shops sell overpriced garbage too.

One of the best things about Diablo 1 was the fun of saving money to buy good stuff from Griswold.- Mobs feel like pests, while you feel like a braindead exterminator who has nothing better to do in life than repeat the same AOE skills the whole time.- Lilith looks like she has an OnlyFans.- Mobs don\'t sound spooky.

Everything is too bright, you can see enemies from afar and you never get caught off guard / jumped by a tougher mob.- The graphics are less cartoonish than Diablo 3 but still cartoonish.- Blizzard has cut corners by not having your character narrate your dialogue selection. At least he\'s not mute altogether.- What\'s the deal with the Butcher teleporting to you \"from Hell\" in dungeons and being extremely overpowered? Who thought that was a better idea than having him await you in his bloody room full of chopped limbs?- The lack of horse mount/dismount animation is just laughable considering the game\'s price.- The game crashes often on a high-end rig (no crashes in other games).- Lag in a Diablo game, how about that.Like many other brands and products in various industries, the birth of \"Diablo 4\" relied on not much more than the reputation gained from its past successes, namely the first 2 installments. And since they keep going in the wrong direction, it\'s time for this franchise to go to Hell.',''),(3291,'Season pass and micro transactions on a $110 dollar game is expected from Blizzard but still not cool.',''),(3292,'I\'ve been playing the Diablo series since Diablo 1. I\'ve eagerly awaited each new version from announcement to release. Diablo is a series that has never disappointed or let me down...until now.Diablo 4 is a satisfying action RPG and I strongly recommend it for someone who likes those types of games. I find myself disappointed in it as a Diablo game, though.To keep this short, I just find it to be lacking in all of the areas that normally make a Diablo game great. The trailer featuring Lilith was incredibly interesting. The Lilith in the game...not so much. Every time she\'s in a cut scene it\'s cool but not the \"this is cool!\" levels of cool you\'d normally expect. As you track down Lilith, you encounter numerous mini bosses but none of them are memorable whatsoever and there\'s little buildup to each of them before you fight them. There\'s lore but it\'s lacking and no where near enough. There are lots of monsters along the way but again they all feel so generic. You don\'t feel like you\'re battling a demon outbreak and trying to keep hell from breaking out on earth. You just feel like you\'re hacking and slashing your way through a bunch of generic monsters. In fact, it seems as though many of the monsters you\'re used to fighting from older Diablo games are missing or have been overhauled so much they aren\'t the same experiences.As I played this game, I frequently found myself bored, not sure what my objectives were, and not sure why I was going on the missions I was tasked with carrying out. You\'re given missions but rarely are there more than just a few lines of dialogue explaining WHY you\'re going on the mission. I felt little attachment to the characters and almost no sense of purpose most of the time. This game very much feels like a MMORPG with too much focus on generic filler content and not enough focus on the main storyline. It\'s okay as a generic hack and slash rpg loot game but definitely does not deserve to carry the Diablo name. Therefore, I can\'t recommend it.',''),(3293,'Go play Diablo 2 or 3. Better games for a better price. It\'s ridiculous how bad the connection to the game\'s server is. Official support says its the players fault, but after following every guide imaginable to make this game playable I have given up. I have never had such a bad experience with a game. Constant latency issues, rubber-banding, and lagging for 10 seconds or more makes this nearly unplayable.',''),(3294,'beautiful game, but very booooring',''),(3295,'Use this comment as \"BLIZZARD, WE WANT DIABLO 2 ON STEAM! NOW!\" button.',''),(3296,'Prologue: You are a developer at Blizzard, back in the 2010s. You\'re working on Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty. The pressure is high, Starcraft Brood War quickly became the most popular esport and has continued to enjoy massive success since then. You didn\'t work on it, but some of your bosses did, so you trust their design chops. You work late hours, you see the progress being made. The map editor is extremely impressive. Both simple in use and filled with features. It feels like just a few steps below an entire game engine. \"If they open up GalaxyScripting to the public...\" you think. Warcraft 3\'s editor invented entire new game genres, and you can easily see someone creating an entire video game with this new editor. Crunch. Crunch. More crunch. There\'re issues with matchmaking that you can see won\'t be fixed before launch, but you know this project won\'t be abandoned, and you can see it\'s shining future. This might just be the new gold standard in the RTS genre.Months pass...You\'re working on Heart of The Swarm now, the first expansion for Starcraft 2. You hear some noise from your friends on the WoW team, they\'re adding a purchasable cosmetic mount, 25 dollars. It gets announced, and the WoW fanbase revolts. \"This is ridiculous! You can\'t do this! This is going to ruin the integrity of the game!\" they say, and you agree. It\'ll potentially lessen the in game achievements of players. You don\'t think it\'s a good idea, but you think it\'ll probably flop, and they higher ups will likely abandon it in the long term. They\'ll probably just raise the subscription price, that seems like the best choice. People who play aren\'t going to stop playing because of a $5 or $10 increase per month. It\'ll make it harder for new players to justify joining, but that seems like a problem that can be solved.The sparkle pony is released. Things are quiet in work for a few days, not much noise. But then, you\'re talking to your boss, and he seems... flustered. Upset? Angry? Depressed? Worried? You\'re not sure, but you can tell something\'s wrong. The Sparkle Pony, that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pony. It made more money in a day/a few days than *all of the revenue combined* from Starcraft 2 WoL. That doesn\'t seem possible, but it\'s true. That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pony made more money from those stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ losers playing WoW than Starcraft 2 WoL did. All your work seems pointless. You know the guy who made the pony, he made it in a day. None of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiots playing WoW could resist buying that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pony. Some of them lie and say they didn\'t when the really did. An absurd amount of money. Disgusting. The average gamer is disgusting. It\'s not just whales. That\'s a lie the average gamer tells themselves to justify their spending. \"I\'m not a whale, so it\'s fine\". ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ these people. You can already see it. Gaming is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Pandora\'s box is open. Publicly traded corporations have a legal responsibility to their investors. Not including some form of this ♥♥♥♥ in games might literally be *illegal*. Everything\'s ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Today:Diablo 4 is a Microsoft Activision Blizzard King game. What a name for a company. It\'s quite a good game, actually my favourite ARPG. It strikes an extremely good balance between simplicity and complexity. People will obviously compare it to Path of Exile. Path of Exile is essentially inapproachable unless you are willing to read a build guide. In which case, you are just opting to not engage with the puzzle/tactics side of the game where you learn about your abilities, the stat systems and damage calculations, and other systems and how they interweave and how you can exploit them to create powerful builds. I\'m positive if I put the effort towards it I could dismantle the build system of PoE and create some cool builds, but that would take a lot of work, that I much better put towards understanding more compelling games with consequences other than \"numbers go brrrr\". I vastly prefer to approach video games without a guide (a practice which seems to unfortunately be very uncommon nowadays). This is what I think Diablo 4 does really well with. I have not read any build guides or any external material. I have spent time experimenting and figuring out how to build builds for each of the classes. Say we could define a unit of measurement to describe cognitive effort, let\'s call it CEP (cognitive effort points), as well as a unit of measurement to describe joy, hedonics, or valence, which we\'ll call VP (valence points).  In Diablo 4, for every 1 CEP I receive 1 VP. Whereas in PoE, for every 1 CEP I receive .01 VP. I\'ve noticed this in other games as well. For example, I feel as though Slay the Spire does and extremely good job with this. If I play the game somewhat mindlessly, I have some fun. But my enjoyment and skill at the game rises greatly the more thought I put into it. At some point, there\'s a drop off, where the increase of enjoyment doesn\'t rise with CEP as much. Some people have put effort towards mathematically solving Slay the Spire, which is fascinating, but I am not as smart as those people, and I think that it would be more difficult than enjoyable for me to work on that problem. They research is fascinating to read, however.Diablo 4, without guides, has a decent CEP/VA curve *for me*. There\'s too much grinding to pay attention fully the whole time, which is why I typically play while listening to a video/podcast/book, but that\'s expected for the genre. I suspect a lot of players who dislike the game have not tried playing the game without following a build guide, and instead trying to figure it out on their own instead the whole way through. The art style is great, so much better than Diablo 3. The story and sidequests are great, also much better than Diablo 3. There are so many little details in the world that add to the world-building, and foreshadow future events in the story. This is the best thing the game does that I wasn\'t expecting. I was really surprised at how satisfying it was to explore the world and the towns and the people and their stories.The music is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Even if you don\'t buy this game, go ahead and listen to the sound track. It\'s excellent. I\'m a professional violinist, and I would absolutely love to someday play some of the quartet/chamber music from this game. It\'s excellent. Now to the elephant in the room. You know what? I can\'t blame Blizzard for adding in cosmetics. I\'m tired of people just blaming the corporations for this ♥♥♥♥ being games. Yeah, Bobby Kotick is a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who [[censored so I don\'t get in trouble]]. But also, it wouldn\'t be added if people didn\'t buy it. And it\'s not just a few people, it\'s a bunch of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Take your sparkle pony. You earned it.Diablo 4 is worth it. It\'s the best ARPG out currently. I haven\'t even touched Lost Ark, or how one of the most outspoken people against Diablo 4\'s monetization (Asmonbald) has spent more money in Lost Ark than some of his audience makes in a year. \"Oh but it\'s for\" shut up. Literally nothing justifies spending tens of thousands of dollars on a pay-to-win videogame, and any justifications are just deflection or a defense mechanism.',''),(3297,'There is no reason a single player experience should have lag.',''),(3298,'10/10 don\'t have to play mahjong to get all achievements',''),(3299,'I\'ve... given up my past, my life, and even my nameAs I am awaiting the release of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, to my surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio released Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. This takes place after the events of Yakuza 6 and during the events of the 7th game. This title uses the action beat-em-up gameplay that the previous games have done, rather than the turn-based RPG mechanics that were used in Y7.Pros and ConsProsFantastic story with many twistsVery fun gameplay with a lot of abilitiesFun upgrades and interesting gadgetsTons of side content to doExcellent soundtrackBeautiful graphics that look amazingConsThe story is a bit on the shorter sideAgent style is a little underwhelmingStoryKazuma Kiryu is now putting his Yakuza life behind him, assuming the name of Joryu and effectively becoming a dead man to everyone he loves and the world. However, one night during a mission he was assigned to someone seems to know what actually happened to him and wants to bring him out of hiding. Joryu must find out what is actually going on and take down whoever is trying to expose him but it also seems a lot more is going on than it seems.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3111729471 The only issue I had with the story in this game, is that it’s really short. I completed it in like 6-7 hours at best. The story for this game is honestly fantastic, it fills in some gaps that Y7 had and the characters are overall amazing. It will also showcase some events from Y7 as well as some of the characters making a cameo appearance. To top it all off, the ending to this game actually made me shed some tears which is one of the first and only games to do so.GameplayThe gameplay is very fun, and I enjoyed playing through the beat-em-based combat as always. This is also the first game where I played on professional difficulty, which was manageable for me. You have access to two fighting styles, Agent and Yakuza, each having its own set of skills and abilities for Joryu to utilize. Agent style allows him to use the Daidoji Factions’s specialized martial arts. It’s a fighting style that is very fast-paced, with fast punches and kicks. Joryu can also use special gadgets in combat, including a grappling hook called the Spider, AI drones to home in on enemies called Hornets, Jet engines on his shoes called Serpents, and Firefly - a bomb disguised as a cigarette.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3111727742Then there is the Yakuza fighting style, which is more mixed with the Brawler and Dragon style used in the previous games. It now has triple finishers and a new red aura so your enemies can know you are a threat. All of his heat actions are back, from all the way back to the first Yakuza game, with two new ones added to spice things up. Overall, the Yakuza style is a slower fighting style and the one I used the most during combat, as it was my preferred choice.There are also times in the game when enemies do a special attack that will do massive damage. Joryu can counter these moves with a counterattack and deal some damage to the enemy while doing so. The Heat Action Meter has also changed - if you take damage the Heat Action Meter will no longer deplete, the only attacks that can make it deplete are ones that use electricity.While in Extreme Heat Mode any damage done to Joryu will be done to the meter instead and will keep doing this until it’s depleted or shut off. There is also gear you can equip that will help you out in combat by providing state buffs.To get upgrades in the game, you can do side content to get money and Akame Points. The latter are given to you after you are done with a side quest. You can get stuff like new moves, health, attack damage, etc. There is a ton of side content to do and I did a bunch of it throughout my playthrough to make sure I got enough Akame Points to get some upgrades. I never had an issue with getting enough Akame Points, though I did have an issue getting money as that is also used to get upgrades. However, there are ways to get money - it’s just that I ran out most of the time getting upgrades and buying healing items.As mentioned before, The Akame Network has a few side quests for you to complete that will earn you money and Akame Points. There are also Stroll and Patrol missions for you to complete that will give you the same rewards. This can raise your Akame Rank and the higher it is, your rank will go up in the Castle, which is a secret area you can visit that has a colosseum for you to fight other people.However, I do have one issue with the gameplay and that is with the Agent style; it’s underwhelming. The issue comes with the fact that the Yakuza style is better for taking out enemies as a whole. While the Spider Gadget is useful for crowd control and there are upgrades to grab more enemies with it, that also has an issue. To use any of the gadgets you have to hold down the button. So, for example, if I want to use the Spide Gadget, I will have to hold the B button on my controller and this applies to the other ones as well. To get them out is a bit slow and you are kind of a sitting duck while doing so.Except for the Serpent gadget, that one makes you move and it seems to be quick to activate. I wish I could have used Firefly more but besides the delay of holding X and the time it takes for the smoke to explode, it\'s not worth it as sometimes it will be out of range of enemies and can hurt you and your allies.Graphics and PerformanceThe graphics for the game are honestly beautiful with some of the scenes being simply breathtaking, all backed up with a fantastic soundtrack.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3111728377I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. I experienced no issues while I was playing, and the game ran fine for me. Although there were some drops in my frames a few times that may be due to the fact I need new PC parts, only time will tell if I can run the next game.Final VerdictI had a ton of fun with Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, but I need to mention that if you are someone who is starting out with the series, I\'d avoid this game for now, as you won’t understand the story of this game all that well. Also, the game is only 6-7 hours long. There is a lot of side content but that only brings it up to about 20-40 hours in length. I’d wait for a sale before buying this game as 64.99 CDN is a lot of money if you only want to focus on the game\'s story.Listen, I been around the block a time or two, and I\'ll tell ya something, Life Needs a Little Sin  has some great quality reviews',''),(3300,'The best dragon engine game by far, even better than Lost JudgmentThe story is extremely good but a little on the shorter side because this game is a \'\'side game\'\'For a \'\'side game\'\' this game has too much contentThis game has: the best colisseum with multiple playable characters, pocket circuit (again), a lot of substories and judgment esque side cases and on top of that the combat is by far the best in the series.The combat feels nice but I found myself to have even more fun by using the Like A Dragon Gaiden Deluxe mod made by Tacoman805 on NexusMods, but even without mods the games combat is just too much fun.I cannot stress this enough.

It seemed like recycled content with some Kiryu story that could have been part of the other games. But as more info got out and I learned more my interest got picked. Now I regard this among my favorites.I think right now my ranking goes something like this: Y0, Y7, YK2, Gaiden, YK1, Y5, Y6, Y3, Y4.In the end I feel that although shorter, this is a complete Yakuza package. Everything we\'ve come to love and expect is here. Twisting heavy drama story, whacky side quests, great minigames, memorable characters, awkward content to explain to your loved ones, Japanese weirdness and so on. The difference is that the game does all this without any bloat.I really liked how they portrayed Kiryu in this one and made him a bit more human. I also really enjoyed some of the new characters and how they got developed throughout the game. And I loved Akame! More Akame in the next games or we riot!I think RGG packaged the story they had with just the right amount of side stuff and fluff to leave you wanting just a bit more in the end. Which sucks!

While it seems Infinite Wealth will be our farewell to Kiryu, Gaiden feels like a heartfelt farewell to the games that introduced us to him.The gameplay was a lot of fun. I\'ll admit, I definitely favored one style over the other, but even primarily using one style throughout most of the game, I still had a blast playing. As per usual, this game is chock full of minigames and side stories to invest your time in to, and they are absolutely worth it! Also in usual RGG fashion, the soundtrack was phenomenal. While being a game focused on Kiryu, it featured a cast of primarily new characters, and I loved them. Akame was an instant favorite for me. Shishido and Hanawa were strong favorites as well. But the story is where this game absolutely shines. It maintained continuity from the stories that came before, while also building up immense anticipation for the next game to come. The ending in particular was phenomenal.This game was absolutely meant for the Yakuza fans who have been along for Kiryu\'s entire journey. If you\'re new to the series, this absolutely should not be your starting point. But it is a fantastic destination to look forward to.',''),(3306,'My only male fantasy is to see Kiryu happy.',''),(3307,'A painful sort of parting. Let me state up front that, despite what Sega\'s marketing claims, this is the absolute worst place to start the Yakuza franchise. Not because of its quality, but because this feels like the closing epilogue to a saga that spans close to two decades in releases. I\'ve played Yakuza for going on twelve years at this point, ever since importing the Japanese release of Yakuza 5, then emulating the originals, and slowly working forward from there. It\'s given me great joy to see the new waves of popularity RGG have rightfully gotten in the wake of Yakuza 0\'s debut in the West, and it gives me even greater joy to see that rather than sit on their laurels, they\'ve consistently pushed themselves to make each new release as great as it can be. Gaiden is a side game, and that nature is plenty evident in everything from its skeleton to its skin. It simply lacks the wide variety of content that the mainline franchise is well known for. It tries, and my hour count- I hope- serves as sufficient evidence to show you\'ll get plenty of bang for your buck, but I would strongly encourage you to temper your expectations somewhat before diving in, and I think you\'ll be pleasantly surprised as a result. I don\'t want to speak overlong on the story, because I consider it Gaiden\'s greatest strength. If you\'ve been following Kiryu through the course of his life, from 0 to 6, then this absolutely *is not* something you want to sit out. Speaking personally, it\'s the sweetest kind of pain seeing what he goes through in Gaiden. It\'s the sappy, Valjean-esque sort of drama you\'ve come to expect from Yakuza, but it hits home all the more simply because it\'s Kiryu. To see an immovable force of nature show the scars and strain behind his stoicism wasn\'t only deeply moving, it was heart-wrenching. Because of Gaiden, because of the momentum RGG have been picking up with Yakuza 7 and Lost Judgment, I am wholeheartedly certain that Yakuza 8 will be their crowning masterpiece, and a game that\'ll leave me utterly broken with tears. I cannot wait.',''),(3308,'JORYU!',''),(3309,'Gaiden is the new peak of YakuzaAs a reminder: Do not play this before completing Yakuza 0-7This game is a conclusion of all the Yakuza games released to this day. Playing this first would be the same as watching the final Season of Attack on Titan or any other good series before Season 1-4. You would ruin your experience.Now for the review:Kazuma Kiryu is back, for better or worse, depending on how you see it, but on a technical level, this game takes everything that made Yakuza 6 and Kiwami 2 amazing and improves it quite a bit: Combat Kiryu keeps his Dragon of Dojima style, which is now called the Yakuza style, but it’s slightly nerved in comparison to Y6 and K2. They made it slightly slower and took away two of the side-steps, you can only do one now (and you get a roll upgrade later) otherwise the moveset is mostly unchanged.The star of the show is the new Agent style. It’s mixture of Yagamis Crane and Kiryus old rush style with some new gadgets, which are really fun to use.Gameplay wise Agent style is superior, especially on harder difficulties, due the nerving of Yakuza style and it generally being faster.One of the biggest changes in terms of combat is the number of enemies you can fight at once. Some battles (mostly in the Colliseum) makes you fight up to 20 enemies at once. After this game, One Man Army Kiryu definitely deserves his title. Minigames The main story might be shorter but in terms of minigames and side content, Gaiden has almost as much content as a normal Yakuza game: Improved Pocket Circuit Racing Improved Colliseum with it’s own Subplot including Team Battles and the opportunity to control and fight with different characters other than Kiryu. A mixture of Judgment side cases and and the classic Substories. It’s presented in a similar way as in Judgment but play out like the classic funny substories we know from Yakuza.New and old Karaoke songs, including BakamitaiBilliard for the first time in the Dragon EngineHostess Club (They made it worse and more creepy by using real actresses, but it’s there for the people who like it).Additionally, something, that doesn’t really fit into any of the Subcategories: You change the appearance of Kiryu now.Some outfits from older games return or you can just dress him up as a clown, and it will affect almost every cutscene!Now for the most important part of the game: The PlotIn terms of story writing, it\'s kind of amazing to think that the entire situation of Kiryu, where everything started to go downhill for him, begun in Yakuza 5 or more specifically it\'s ending.Before that, all Yakuza games had it\'s of own concluded stories without any big impact for it\'s successors, but with Yakuza 5 and successor Yakuza 6, everything changed:Kiryu ends up in prison due the aftermaths of Yakuza 5 (2012)Haruka leaves Morning Glory Orphanage due unwanted attention by media (sometime between 2012-2014)Haruka meets Yuta (2014)Haruka gets hospitalized due her involvement with Yuta (2016)Kiryu fakes his death to protects his family (2016)Which leads to Gaiden (2019-2020)Which then leads to Infinite Wealth, due the affairs in Gaiden and Yakuza 7. (2023)The entirety of Yakuza 6 and Gaiden could have been prevented, if Kiryu would have been there to protect Haruka. The decision Kiryu made at the end of Yakuza 5 to go into prison were the trigger for everything that took place afterwards. You could even go further back and say that Kiryus decision to let Haruka pursue her dream of becoming an Idol let to all of this, which is impressive to think about.You could say, that this is all an one big arc and it\'s still ongoing for 11/12 years now.If the writers of Yakuza, or Like a Dragon, how it’s called now, planned this from the start, it’s actually really good story writing. Now we will have to see how it continues in Like a Dragon Infinite WealthThe sum it up, without spoiling the game, this game has definitely the most emotional scene in the entire franchise with one of the best voice acting pieces I’ve ever heard, which would even make the toughest Yakuza cry.

Which is a shame, since about a third of the game\'s content revolves around said tournament mode, which requires you to have high-level clan members to progress through the side-story.I would only buy this game at full price for the story or if you\'re a big RGG fan.

The map consists in only the city of Sotenbori, and later on the castle, and at start I wished Kiryu could have evolved through a different area, city, as he was supposed to be \"incognito\".Well . . . fact is, now that I\'ve finished the game, I feel just blown away by those few dozens of hours I\'ve played, and its\' captivating story; it\'s a Yakuza title that is very worthy to appear in the series, even essential - with an ending that is certainly long, but \"Grand Finale\" style. And I think that what strongly participated to my feeling of satisfaction in the end was, as for other Yakuza games I\'ve played (including the Judgment ones), I just took my time, with the mini-games, with the Coliseum, and the Akame requests - and all just fit together perfectly, the game was a real blast and don\'t regret one bit playing this to the end. I also felt that the combat difficulty was a bit higher, which I appreciated.It isn\'t perfect though, some lengthy grinding may be necessary for the Coliseum for instance; or once again, the map is actually the most limited in the series - but whatever, Like a Dragon Gaiden is a total banger, mostly if you care to not rush it and explore well all of its\' map and everything it has to offer.So if you already played and liked some games of the franchise, you can buy this with no hesitation ; and if you\'re a newcomer, my personal advice would be to play the games in the most chronological order possible, starting with Yakuza 0, the first game in the series, and a most well reputed one, for all its\' great qualities and fun. But overall I can only recommend such a great game, that made me feel that RGG took all possible care in respecting their audience and followers, and executed that close to perfectly.','');
